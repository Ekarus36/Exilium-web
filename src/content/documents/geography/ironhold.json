Advancement through merit (skill demonstrations, service). Outsiders without rank are \"Unranked\"—lowest status but not mistreated.\n\n**Citizen Classes:**\n- **Ranked Citizens**: Hobgoblins with full status\n- **Attached Workers**: Non-hobgoblins with useful skills (partial rights)\n- **Unranked**: Visitors, temporary workers (minimal rights)\n- **Bonded**: Criminals working off debts (no rights)\n\n**Work Hours**: Everyone works six days, rests one. Shifts run like clockwork. Tardiness is punished. Quality failures are punished worse.\n\n### Economy\n\n**Exports**: Weapons, armor, anchors, chains, ship fittings, tools, metal goods of all kinds.\n\n**Imports**: Timber (from Skarath/goblins), food (limited local agriculture), luxury goods.\n\n**The Skarath Partnership**: Essential symbiosis. Ironhold sends metal components; Skarath sends timber. Trade caravans run constantly.

  "secretKnowledge": "### Kethrak's Ambition\n\nThe Forge Marshal doesn't just want to run Ironhold—he wants to transform the Broken Isles into a proper nation. United under hobgoblin discipline. Organized. Efficient. Powerful.\n\n**His long-term plan:**\n1. Build Ironhold's military strength\n2. Secure alliance with Skarath (already done)\n3. Gain influence on The Moot\n4. Eventually challenge The Storm for control\n\n**The problem**: [Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) terrifies him. Kethrak knows he can't move openly while The Storm lives. So he waits. Builds. Plans.\n\n### The Slave Question\n\nIronhold officially uses \"Bonded Labor\" (criminals and debtors working off sentences). Unofficially, they buy slaves from The Drowned and other sources, then \"convict\" them of invented crimes to make it legal.\n\n**The records are falsified.** The Ironmaster of Order keeps two sets of books. If exposed, it would damage Ironhold's reputation for law and honor—the foundation of their society.\n\n### The Volcanic Risk\n\nThe geothermal vents that power the forges are slowly becoming more active. Tremors have increased over the past decade. The Council knows but hasn't told the population.\n\n**Worst case**: The crater could erupt, destroying the Forge District and killing thousands. The Council is quietly researching alternatives but has found nothing.\n\n### Hidden Factions\n\n**The Old Guard**: Senior hobgoblins who remember before the Confederation. They're loyal to hobgoblin tradition, not the Isles. If Kethrak moved to break from the Confederation, they'd support him.\n\n**The Reformers**: Younger hobgoblins who've worked alongside other races. They question whether \"hobgoblin superiority\" is real. Quietly. Very quietly.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Falsified Records** | Someone has evidence that Ironhold's \"Bonded Labor\" includes slaves. Expose it or bury it for a price? |\n| **The Tremors** | Volcanic activity is increasing. The Council wants it investigated quietly. What's causing it? |\n| **The Marshal's Agent** | Kethrak needs something done that can't be traced to Ironhold. Deniable assets required. |\n| **The Reformer** | A young hobgoblin officer wants to defect—to Veraheim. Help them escape, or turn them in? |\n| **The Skarath Crisis** | A trade dispute threatens the partnership. Both cities need mediators before it becomes war. |\n| **The Old Weapon** | Deep in the crater, miners found something ancient. Pre-hobgoblin. Dangerous.
