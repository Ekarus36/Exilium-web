It consists of two major parts:\n\n- A dev server that serves your source files over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), with [rich built-in features](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html) and astonishingly fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).\n\n- A [build command](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html) that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.\n\nIn addition, Vite is highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.\n\n[Read the Docs to Learn More](https://vite.dev).\n",
