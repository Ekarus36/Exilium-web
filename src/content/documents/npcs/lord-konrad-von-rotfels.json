  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nWeathered, salt-cured look. Greying brown hair worn long. Blue eyes that squint from years at sea. Tanned, lined face. Dresses practically with nautical touches. Walks with slight roll—sea legs never quite left. Speaks directly, shipboard manner.\n\n### Personality\nPractical, direct, thinks in nautical terms. Slightly out of place among land Lords. Loyal to family and crew. Suspicious of inland politics. Would rather be at sea than at court. Doesn't understand why the Kingdom ignores maritime threats.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Helene (née Graustein, 47) - Lord Graustein's sister. Hates the coast, seasick, homesick for mountains. Unhappy marriage.\n- **Heir:** Erik (26) - Lives on ships more than land. Natural sailor. Popular with crew. Unmarried.\n- **Second Son:** Magnus (23) - Handles business side. Less romantic about the sea. Keeps domain running.\n- **Sister:** Isabeau (45) - Married to Lord Valcourt. Also unhappy (wants to be home).\n- **Daughter:** Kirsten (19) - Wild, unconventional. Wants to sail. Driving away suitors deliberately.\n\n### Domain & Fleet\nRules ~10,000 coastal folk. Commands 800 soldiers plus 12 warships—the Kingdom's only fleet. Also ~30 fishing vessels that can be armed. Produces fish, salt, and naval services.\n\n### Political Position\nMost isolated Lord. Different concerns, different culture. Often forgotten in Kingdom politics—partly intentional. Neither asset nor threat to the crown. Attends minimum court functions.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nKonrad is a sailor who happens to be a Lord, not the other way around. He still personally captains ships sometimes. He sees himself as an admiral, not a politician. The Kingdom's indifference to maritime threats genuinely frustrates him—he knows the Broken Isles pirates are a real danger.\n\n### The Pirate Problem\nThe Broken Isles are closer than most realize:\n- Occasional raids on fishing boats\n- Trade sometimes disrupted\n- Konrad wants resources to fight back\n- Kingdom doesn't prioritize naval threats\n- His small fleet can only defend, not attack\n\n### Erik's Secret Contacts\nThe heir has been doing something questionable:\n- Has met with Broken Isles captains\n- \"Know your enemy,\" officially\n- Perhaps building toward something\n- Father doesn't know the full extent\n- Could be espionage, defection, alliance, or just intelligence gathering\n\n### The Pirate Trade\nSome Rotfels merchants trade with Saltmere (pirate port):\n- Officially forbidden\n- Practically necessary\n- Konrad knows but can't stop it\n- Gold flows both ways\n\n### Kirsten's Escape Plan\nThe daughter has been learning to sail secretly:\n- Several sailors are teaching her\n- Plans to run away to sea if forced into marriage\n- Father might help her if he knew\n- Mother would be horrified\n\n### Helene's Misery\nThe Graustein marriage was political—both parties regret it:\n- Helene is seasick, homesick, miserable\n- Her children take after their father (her disappointment)\n- She provides some intelligence to her Graustein relatives\n- The marriage connects Rotfels to the Graustein succession crisis\n\n### What He Wants\n- Larger fleet\n- Kingdom investment in naval power\n- Secure waters for his people\n- To be left alone by court politics\n\n### What He Fears\n- Major pirate raid he can't stop\n- Being drawn into land conflicts\n- Kingdom ignoring maritime threats until too late\n- His heirs abandoning the sea\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Pirate Contact** | Erik's meetings with pirates are discovered.
