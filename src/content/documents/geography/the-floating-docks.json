  "commonKnowledge": "### Who Lives Here\n\n**The Desperate**: Refugees too poor to qualify, day laborers who can't afford housing, families saving to earn city entry.\n\n**The Unwanted**: Criminals fleeing justice, outcasts expelled from Veraheim, those even the sanctuary won't accept.\n\n**The Hopeful**: Young people proving themselves, craftsmen building reputation for shop challenges, anyone still dreaming of earning a place above.\n\n### The Four Types of Floats\n\n**Tavern Floats** (Commercial):\n- **The Rusty Anchor** - Largest tavern, neutral ground, run by Marin Saltwhisker\n- **Mama Kresh's Haven** - Safest place on the Floats, run by half-orc Kreshna, families prioritized\n- **The Siren's Call** - Gang-controlled gambling den and brothel\n\n**Community Floats** (Residential):\n- **Drow Haven** - 30 drow, tightest community, led by elder Velara Shadowmend\n- **Little Hearth** - Halfling families, the Tealeafs, warmest despite poverty\n- **New Hope** - Human refugees, led by carpenter Gareth Ashwood, most vulnerable\n\n**Gang Floats** (Criminal):\n- **The Undertow** - Tide Reapers headquarters\n- **The Silent Deep** - Barnacles headquarters\n- **The Bloody Wake** - The Drowned headquarters\n\n**Service Floats** (Independent):\n- **Torvin's Repairs** - Dwarf shipwright, pays all three gangs\n- **Life's Blood** - Water barge, gouges prices, everyone needs him\n- **Last Chance** - Supply barge, fair prices, genuinely good people\n- **Elder's Platform** - Neutral ground for disputes, run by mysterious Old Shen\n\n### The Three Gangs\n\n**The Tide Reapers** (~40 members) - Largest, most professional\n- Leader: Roderick \"The Eel\" Saltborn (former Veraheim guard)\n- Operations: Protection rackets, smuggling, prostitution, gambling\n- Territory: Eastern Floats, closest to harbor\n- Style: Calculated cruelty, intimidation first\n\n**The Barnacles** (~20 members) - Information brokers\n- Leader: Zephyr Nightscale (tiefling spymaster)\n- Operations: Blackmail, theft, forgery, selling secrets\n- Territory: Western Floats, quiet corners\n- Style: Manipulation over violence, knows everyone's dirt\n\n**The Drowned** (~15 members) - Most violent\n- Leader: Skar Bloodtide (half-orc, brutal)\n- Operations: Robbery, kidnapping, slave trade, murder for hire\n- Territory: Southern edge, most dangerous\n- Style: Direct violence, terror, no subtlety\n\n### Daily Life\n\n**Morning**: Day workers queue at harbor lifts, ~200 ascend to Veraheim. Earn 3-8 copper for labor.\n\n**Afternoon**: Workers return, spend earnings on supplies. Gangs collect protection fees.\n\n**Evening**: Sunset bell rings—non-residents must descend. Taverns fill. Violence rises.\n\n**Night**: Gang activity peaks. Theft, beatings, kidnappings. Bodies in the water by dawn.\n\n### Economics of Desperation\n\n- Average earnings: 3-6 copper/day\n- Cost of survival: 4-5 copper/day (food, water, protection)\n- One bad day = starvation\n- Life expectancy: ~40 years (vs 60-70 in Veraheim)\n- Child mortality: 1 in 4 don't reach age 10\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### Why Vera Doesn't Intervene\n\nThe official reasons (pragmatism):\n- 300 guards barely enough for Veraheim\n- Floats are \"international waters\"\n- No solution to root problem\n- Cleaning out gangs just pushes crime underground\n\n**The real reason**: The Floats are the price of Veraheim's idealism.\n\nVera built a perfect city for 3,500 people. The Floats hold everyone who couldn't fit. Without them, desperate people would riot at the lifts. The Floats are a pressure valve—necessary, tolerated, unfixable.\n\n**Her guilt**: She sees the Floats from her window every day. She secretly funds Mama Kresh's Haven. She ensures the water barge never runs dry. But she won't intervene officially because if she overextends protecting the Floats, the city falls, and then no one is saved.\n\n**The uncomfortable truth**: Some Veraheim merchants profit from Float poverty. Cheap labor. Black market smuggling. Tax avoidance. The political will for intervention is low.\n\n### The Black Market Pipeline\n\n1. Smugglers bring goods to Floating Docks\n2. Float workers bring goods up via day passes (hidden in pockets)\n3. Corrupt Veraheim merchants buy at below-market (no tax)\n4. Sell in city at normal price (pocket the difference)\n\nWho benefits: Gangs, corrupt merchants, smugglers. Who loses: Veraheim's tax revenue, Vera's vision of fairness.\n\n### Gang Secrets\n\n**Tide Reapers**: Roderick was expelled from Veraheim's guard for corruption. He still has contacts inside. Three guards take bribes to look away from smuggling.\n\n**The Barnacles**: Zephyr has blackmail material on two Veraheim council members. He's never used it—saving it for something big. He also manipulates The Drowned, feeding them targets to keep them away from his operations.\n\n**The Drowned**: Skar doesn't know she's being played by the Barnacles. She thinks she's independent. Also, she sold people to slavers from the Broken Isles—if this became public, even the other gangs would turn on her.\n\n### The Unwritten Rule\n\nAll three gangs have one agreement: **Don't let violence get so bad that Veraheim intervenes.** If guards come down in force, everyone loses their income. Keep it \"manageable.\" Bodies in the water are fine. Open warfare isn't.\n\n### Notable NPCs (Hidden Depths)\n\n**Old Shen** (Elder's Platform): No one knows his past. Rumored to have been an Imperial spymaster. Has blackmail on all three gang leaders. Keeps the peace through fear of exposure. If he dies, gang war erupts within days.\n\n**Sylvara \"Syl\" Nightwhisper** (Siren's Call manager): Works for Tide Reapers but secretly feeds information to the Barnacles. Plans to play both sides until she can buy her freedom. Would betray anyone for enough gold.\n\n**Velara Shadowmend** (Drow Haven): She's not just a community leader—she was a priestess of Velandra before fleeing the Empire 60 years ago. Still has contacts among drow refugees. If the drow ever organized across the Floats, she'd lead them.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Missing Children** | Three children vanished last week. The Drowned are selling to slavers. Can the PCs stop them before the ship leaves? |\n| **Mama Kresh's Secret** | Someone's been delivering anonymous gold to Mama Kresh for years. It's Vera. If this became public, it would undermine Veraheim's \"merit only\" ideology. |\n| **The Uprising** | Gareth Ashwood is secretly organizing the community floats. He plans to demand Veraheim expand or face a blockade of the harbor. Will it work or get everyone killed? |\n| **Gang War** | Old Shen is dying. The gangs are positioning. When he goes, war erupts. Can the PCs prevent it—or profit from it? |\n| **The Corrupt Guards** | Three Veraheim guards take bribes from the Tide Reapers. Thaelen suspects but can't prove it. Find evidence—but exposing them might reveal how deep the corruption goes. |\n| **Escape from the Drowned** | A prisoner on the Bloody Wake knows something about Imperial agents in Veraheim. Rescue them before Skar sells them to slavers. |\n\n### The Moral Weight\n\nThe Floating Docks exist to show players that idealism has limits. Veraheim is a sanctuary—but not for everyone. Someone always pays the price.\n\n**Questions for players:**\n- Is Vera right to focus on those she can save?\n- Should the city be forced to expand?\n- Is violence against the gangs justified?\n- Can you save everyone? Should you try?\n\n**The unspoken truth**: Every time someone in Veraheim says \"we judge by contribution,\" someone on the Floats drowns because they couldn't contribute enough.\n\n---",
