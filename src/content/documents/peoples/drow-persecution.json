The Empire's response was genocide—and they've never stopped.\n\nDrow cannot exist openly anywhere in Imperial territory. The Aloria won't deal with them publicly (maintaining elven relations matters more than morality). The Broken Isles don't care.

  "commonKnowledge": "### The Policy\n\n**\"Kill on sight\"** means exactly that:\n- Any drow found in Imperial territory is executed immediately\n- No trial, no hearing, no appeal\n- No exceptions for age, gender, or circumstance\n- Drow born centuries after the Dragon War are equally guilty\n- Helping a drow is treason\n\n### International Response\n\n**Aloria:** Won't publicly deal with drow. Not out of hatred—out of political necessity. Maintaining relations with the Empire matters more than moral concerns.\n\n**Broken Isles:** Don't care about elven politics. Skills matter, not species. Several drow serve on pirate crews. [Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) himself is drow.\n\n**Veraheim:** The only place drow can exist openly. Vera's power and Thorongil's presence make Imperial intervention impossible.\n\n### How Drow Survive\n\n**Hidden Communities:** Secret settlements in remote locations. Self-sufficient. Constantly moving to avoid discovery.\n\n**Secret Trade Networks:** Midnight meetings, coded communications, trusted intermediaries, black market connections. Often through Veraheim contacts.\n\n**The Broken Isles:** Refuge among pirates who value skill over species.\n\n**Veraheim:** Open existence, but limited space. The city can only hold so many.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Hidden Truth\n\nThe official history says drow tortured dragons, causing the war, justifying genocide.\n\n**The full truth** (known only to a few):\n- The conflict started as a territorial dispute between drow and elves\n- Both sides committed atrocities\n- The dragon-torture was real but was **retaliation**, not unprovoked\n- Elves struck first\n- The genocide was born from rage and shame, not pure justice\n\n**Who knows:**\n- Emperor Valandor (he ordered the cover-up)\n- [Velindor Shadowmere](/npcs/velindor-shadowmere) (buried the evidence)\n- [Thaelen Ruincalen](/npcs/thaelen-ruincalen) (discovered it; fled)\n- A few drow elders (oral histories, no proof)\n\n### What the Drow Remember\n\nDrow oral histories tell a different story than Imperial records:\n\n**The drow version:**\n- Elves attacked first over territory\n- Drow retaliated with the dragon experiments (trying to create a weapon)\n- The experiments were a faction, not all drow\n- Most drow didn't know until it was too late\n- They've been paying for one faction's crime for 400 years\n\n**How accurate is this?** Partially true. The truth is complicated. Both sides committed wrongs. But the genocide has lasted far longer than any crime deserved.\n\n### The Faction Question\n\nWere all drow responsible, or just a faction?\n\n**The evidence suggests:**\n- The experiments were conducted in three hidden cities\n- Not all drow knew\n- Some drow opposed it\n- Those cities were destroyed (by dragons, not elves)\n- The experimenters are long dead\n\n**Why it matters:** If only a faction was responsible, the genocide has been punishing the innocent for 400 years. But who decides what \"enough punishment\" looks like?\n\n### Modern Drow Identity\n\nDrow born in the last 400 years face an impossible situation:\n- Blamed for crimes before their birth\n- Many don't know the full history\n- Some accept collective guilt\n- Others reject it entirely\n- All must survive regardless\n\n**The generational trauma:** Four centuries of hiding, running, watching family die. The psychological weight is immeasurable. Some drow are broken by it. Others are forged into something harder.\n\n### Velindor's Secret Guilt\n\n[Velindor Shadowmere](/npcs/velindor-shadowmere), the Empire's spymaster, has been hunting drow for centuries. He's also buried evidence that would complicate the genocide's justification.\n\n**His conflict:** He believes in the Empire. He's done terrible things for it. But late at night, he sometimes wonders: at what point does \"justice\" become just another crime?\n\nHe'll never admit this. He'll never stop hunting drow. But the doubt is there.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Survivor** | An ancient drow claims to have been there—in the cities that experimented on dragons. What does she remember? |\n| **The Evidence** | Proof surfaces that elves struck first. Who has it? What happens if it spreads? |\n| **The Faction** | Descendants of drow who opposed the experiments want recognition. Can they prove their ancestors' innocence? |\n| **The Defector** | An Imperial inquisitor who hunted drow wants to defect. Does she deserve redemption? |\n| **The Hidden City** | Rumor of a surviving drow settlement. The Empire wants it found. The drow want it protected. |\n| **Valandor's Doubt** | The Emperor, in private, asks: \"Was I wrong?\" What would change if he acknowledged the truth? |\n\n### Why the Genocide Continues\n\nIt's been 400 years. Why hasn't it ended?\n\n**Political:** Admitting the genocide was wrong would delegitimize 400 years of Imperial policy. Valandor would have to acknowledge his error. The Empire's moral foundation would crack.\n\n**Psychological:** Generations of elves have grown up believing drow deserve death. Changing that belief requires admitting their ancestors (and themselves) participated in unjust killing.\n\n**Practical:** What happens to the drow if the genocide ends? They can't just return to Imperial society. The trauma on both sides is too deep.\n\n**The trap:** The longer it continues, the harder it is to stop. 400 years of killing creates its own justification: \"We can't have been wrong for 400 years.\"\n\n---",
