  "rawContent": "# Vaelorn Steelwind\n\n**Blade Marshal** | Iron Tower (Wardens of the Realm)\n\n> *\"Steelwind doesn't raise his voice. He doesn't need to.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 600+ years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Male |\n| **Role** | Field Commander, Caerwyn's Second |\n| **Reports To** | High Warden Caerwyn |\n| **Location** | Iron Tower or field deployments |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nVaelorn Steelwind is the operational commander of elven military forces—while Caerwyn strategizes, Vaelorn executes. He has led every significant military action for the past 300 years and is considered the finest tactical mind after Caerwyn himself. Veterans trust him more than they fear him.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nCold professionalism masks genuine care for his soldiers. Never wastes words or lives. Known for achieving objectives with minimal casualties—not from sentiment, but because dead soldiers can't fight tomorrow. Respects competence regardless of birth.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Commands from the front, not behind lines\n- Has never lost a battle he personally led\n- Trained under Caerwyn for 200 years before promotion\n- Quietly disagrees with some Imperial policies but never publicly\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nHe believes Thaelen's defection was understandable, not treasonous. He served with Thaelen for a century and saw a good elf, not a traitor. He's never said this aloud. He never will.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Caerwyn**: Superior - Deep mutual respect, 300 years serving together\n- **Seraphel Dawnblade**: Colleague - Knight Commander, occasional tension over resources\n- **Thaelen Ruincalen**: Former comrade - Complex feelings about the defection\n",
