  "commonKnowledge": "### Pre-Persecution History\n\n**The drow were already marginalized before the genocide began.**\n\n**Original status in the Empire:**\n- Considered \"lesser elves\" by high elf majority\n- Darker skin seen as mark of \"corruption\" (religious prejudice)\n- Restricted from highest positions (could not join Four Pillars)\n- Concentrated in lower-status enclaves\n- Intermarriage with high elves discouraged\n\n**The prejudice was old:**\n- Pre-dates Valandor's reign by centuries\n- Origin myths blame drow for ancient crimes (unproven)\n- High elves claimed drow were \"touched by darkness\"\n- Self-fulfilling prophecy: denied opportunity, some drow turned to crime\n\n**The dragon experiments:**\n- A desperate faction thought dragons could be forced to bond\n- If drow had dragon riders, they'd have power\n- The experiments were secret—most drow didn't know\n- When discovered, the Empire blamed all drow\n\n**The escalation:**\n- The torture wasn't unprovoked—it was retaliation for centuries of oppression\n- This doesn't justify it, but explains it\n- Valandor's genocide was also escalation, not justice\n- 400 years later, everyone is wrong and everyone is dead\n\n### Survival Mechanisms\n\n**How do thousands of people survive when the most powerful empire wants them dead?**\n\n#### 1. Hidden Communities\n\n**Small settlements in remote locations:**\n- Deep forests, mountain caves, underground\n- Never more than 50-100 people (larger = easier to find)\n- Move every 5-10 years (or when threatened)\n- Self-sufficient: farming, hunting, crafting\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Limited resources\n- Inbreeding risk in small populations\n- Children grow up knowing only hiding\n- One discovery = everyone dies\n\n#### 2. Passing\n\n**Some drow can hide their heritage:**\n- Magical disguise (illusion spells, items)\n- Staying in shadows (dark skin less visible)\n- Claiming \"cursed\" ancestry (rare but believable)\n- Living where no one knows drow exist\n\n**Risks:**\n- Magic can fail or be detected\n- Intimate relationships are dangerous\n- Children might not pass\n- The psychological cost of denying identity\n\n#### 3. Flight to Safety\n\n**The few places that accept drow:**\n- **Veraheim:** Open acceptance, largest community\n- **Broken Isles:** Pirates don't care about race\n- **Remote Aloria:** Some domains are neglectful enough\n- **Underground:** Literal and figurative\n\n**The journey is deadly:**\n- Empire patrols watch for escapees\n- Aloria won't harbor drow officially\n- The sea is controlled by Empire ships\n- Smugglers charge everything you have\n\n### The Cell Structure\n\n**Drow organization is built for persecution:**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Small cells of 3-7 people\n- Each cell knows one contact in one other cell\n- No one knows the whole network\n- If captured, you can only betray a few\n\n**Communication:**\n- Dead drops in agreed locations\n- Coded messages (seemingly innocent letters)\n- Trusted runners who know multiple cells\n- Emergency signals (specific marks on buildings)\n\n**Leadership:**\n- No single leader (assassination risk)\n- Elders guide but don't command\n- Decisions made by consensus within cells\n- Regional coordination through trusted intermediaries\n\n**New member vetting:**\n- Months of observation before trust\n- Gradual information sharing\n- One betrayal = entire cell relocates\n- Paranoia is survival\n\n### The Veleth\n\nBefore the genocide, drow lived in cities and communities of thousands. Now they survive in *veleth*—groups of 50-100 drow who travel or settle together. The word has no direct translation; it means something like \"thread\" or \"strand\"—survivors woven together.\n\n**The Gatherings**\n\nWhen veleth encounter each other, planned or by chance, it's always cause for celebration. Dinners, stories, catching up—and crucially, young people meeting potential partners from outside their own group.\n\nMarriage follows skills, not tradition: you join whichever veleth values you most. A smith with no smithing work joins a group that needs one. A healer goes where healers are scarce. This fluid movement spreads skills, knowledge, and hope across scattered communities.\n\n### Culture and Identity\n\n**Despite fragmentation, drow maintain cultural continuity:**\n\n#### Religion: Velandra the Hidden Flame\n\n- Goddess of survival, protection in darkness\n- Emphasis on endurance, community, secrecy\n- Prayers are silent (sound can betray you)\n- Rituals involve small flames in darkness (hidden hope)\n\n**Priests/Priestesses:**\n- Often the cell's spiritual center\n- Maintain oral traditions\n- Perform naming ceremonies, funerals\n- Connect scattered communities through shared faith\n\n**The theological question:**\n- Does Velandra hear drow prayers?\n- Some believe she protects them\n- Others believe she's the same god by another name\n- The truly cynical say there's no god—only survival\n\n#### Language: Drow Dialect\n\n- Based on Elvish but distinct\n- Secret hand signs for silent communication\n- Written form rarely used (evidence is dangerous)\n- Speaking openly marks you as drow\n\n#### Art and Music\n\n- Oral traditions (nothing that can be found)\n- Songs sung only in hidden places\n- Craft traditions passed parent-to-child\n- Some work is deliberately unmarked (can't prove drow made it)\n\n#### Naming Traditions\n\n- True names known only to family and close allies\n- Surface names used in dangerous areas\n- Naming ceremonies conducted in secret\n- The dead are remembered by name (never forgotten)\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### Survival Mathematics\n\n**The Genocide**\n\nBefore the Breaking, approximately 70,000 drow lived within the Thelassian—underground cities, deep settlements, communities that had existed for millennia. When the dragons broke their bonds and the Empire sought someone to blame, the drow became targets.\n\nThe initial attacks killed more than half. Drow cities were known; elven forces struck them all. But drow know the depths better than anyone. Survivors fled deeper than elves would follow—into places where the stone itself seems alive, where light has never reached, where the paths end in cliffs over endless darkness.\n\nThe active hunt lasted 50-70 years. After that, the Empire shifted strategy. Now they hunt based on intelligence—specific teams targeting specific \"malicious\" drow, usually resistance fighters. Most drow aren't resistance. Most are just trying to survive.\n\n### Population Breakdown\n\n**Estimated total: 3,000-5,000 drow survive**\n\n| Location | Population | Notes |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| **Underground veleth** | ~2,500-3,500 | Roaming groups, safest from Empire |\n| **Broken Isles** | ~500 | Safe from elves, dangerous otherwise |\n| **Veraheim (citizens)** | <100 | Permanent residents; visitors come and go |\n| **Aloria** | Scattered | Valued skilled workers or cheap labor |\n| **Known total** | **~3,000-5,000** | What outsiders believe exists |\n\n**The numbers are guesses.** No census is possible.\n\n### What Nobody Knows\n\nSomewhere in the depths—past where the caves end in cliffs, across chasms that have no bridges unless you know the secret—there is a city. It preserves everything: history, culture, craftsmanship, knowledge that predates the Empire itself.\n\nNo one outside knows it exists. No one outside knows its population. The 3,000-5,000 estimate accounts only for drow the world has seen.\n\n*The drow remember. The drow endure.*\n\n### The Veraheim Community\n\n**The largest visible free drow community:**\n\n**Demographics:**\n- <100 permanent drow citizens\n- Visitors and transients come and go separately\n- Second-generation residents now common\n- Children growing up without fear (first in 400 years)\n- Elders who remember the flight\n\n**Community structure:**\n- Informal council of elders advises on drow matters\n- [Mirelen Dawnwhisper](/npcs/mirelen-dawnwhisper) is the respected voice\n- Integration with other races encouraged\n- Some maintain drow-only traditions privately\n\n**The generational divide:**\n- Elders carry trauma, hypervigilance\n- Young adults balance identity and integration\n- Children see themselves as Veraheim citizens first\n- Tension between preserving culture and moving forward\n\n**Relationship with Vera:**\n- Mirelen is one of Vera's trusted advisors\n- Drow community deeply loyal to the founders\n- Some would die for Veraheim (and have)\n- Vera's protection makes her a quasi-religious figure to some\n\n### The Underground Network\n\n**Connecting drow across Exilium:**\n\n**The Shadow Road** (Empire territory to Veraheim):\n\n1. Hidden community in Empire identifies escapees\n2. Cell contacts arrange disguise/transport\n3. Route through wilderness (avoiding patrols)\n4. Cross into Aloria (Wolfstein avoided)\n5. Through Thornwood (sympathetic Lord)\n6. Into Ashfeld, then Veraheim\n\n**Time:** 2-6 months depending on circumstances\n**Cost:** Everything you have (or debt to smugglers)\n**Survival rate:** Maybe 60% make it\n\n**The Sea Route** (to Broken Isles):\n\n1. Reach a port city somehow\n2. Contact drow or sympathetic sailors\n3. Smuggled ship to Saltmere or Freehold Harbor\n4. Freedom, but among pirates\n\n**Faster but riskier:** Empire navy patrols the coast\n\n### Vaelith Draegor's Network\n\n**The Storm has his own drow network:**\n\n[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) is 300 years old—he was alive when the genocide began. He runs:\n\n- Information network through the Broken Isles\n- Financial support for some hidden communities\n- Occasional extractions of high-value individuals\n- Intelligence on Empire movements\n\n**His motivation:**\n- Revenge against the Empire (they killed everyone he knew)\n- Power (information is leverage)\n- Perhaps genuine care for his people (unclear)\n\n**Limits:**\n- He's not a liberator—he's a crime lord\n- Help comes with obligations\n- His network serves his interests first\n- Some drow consider him a hero; others a manipulator\n\n### The Elders' Secret\n\n**The oldest drow know things:**\n\n- The dragon experiments were worse than the Empire admits\n- Some experiments \"succeeded\" briefly (forced bonds)\n- Those dragons went mad and had to be killed\n- The experimenters were executed by their own people (before the Empire found them)\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- Proof that the Empire didn't discover the crime first\n- Drow leadership tried to stop it\n- Doesn't justify genocide but complicates the narrative\n- Some elders carry guilt for not stopping it sooner\n\n### Resistance Factions\n\n**Most drow focus on survival. A few want more:**\n\n**The Enduring** (largest faction):\n- Survive, preserve culture, wait for change\n- No direct action against the Empire\n- Hope that centuries from now, things might improve\n- Led informally by elders like Mirelen\n\n**The Avenging** (small, dangerous):\n- Active resistance against the Empire\n- Sabotage, assassination, terror\n- Believe passive survival is slow death\n- Not welcomed by other drow (draws attention)\n\n**The Assimilating:**\n- Give up drow identity, blend in completely\n- \"We can survive by ceasing to exist\"\n- Controversial: preservation vs. practical survival\n- Some families have \"passed\" for generations\n\n**The Returning:**\n- Dream of forcing the Empire to accept them back\n- Believe reconciliation is possible\n- Considered naive by most\n- Point to the dragon war truth as potential leverage\n\n### What Could End the Persecution\n\n**Nothing will end it quickly. But:**\n\n**If the truth spread widely:**\n- Proof that elves struck first in the original conflict\n- Proof that drow leadership tried to stop the experiments\n- Widespread knowledge could create pressure for change\n- But Valandor has suppressed this for 400 years\n\n**If Valandor died:**\n- Succession crisis might allow reform\n- Or might make it worse (scapegoating)\n- Depends entirely on who takes power\n\n**If dragons intervened:**\n- Dragons know the truth (some of them)\n- If they forgave, elves might be shamed into change\n- But dragons are isolationist now\n\n**Most likely path:**\n- Generational change over centuries\n- As Empire interacts with Veraheim, attitudes soften\n- Economic necessity overriding ideology\n- Not justice—just the grinding of time\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Extraction** | High-value drow trapped in Empire needs rescue. Time-limited. |\n| **The Betrayer** | Someone's selling drow locations to the Empire. Find them. |\n| **The Child** | A drow child appears in Veraheim alone. Where's her family? What happened? |\n| **The Avengers** | A radical drow cell plans something that will bring down retaliation on all drow. Stop them? |\n| **The Elder's Truth** | A dying elder wants to record the truth about the experiments. Protect them while they speak. |\n| **The Reunion** | Two drow from the same family, separated 50 years ago. Can you find the other? |\n\n---",

Can you find the other? |\n\n---\n\n## Playing Drow Characters\n\n### The Weight of History\n\n**A drow character in Exilium carries:**\n\n- 400 years of collective trauma\n- Personal losses (almost every drow has lost someone)\n- Constant awareness of danger\n- Skills born from survival (stealth, paranoia, reading people)\n\n**This can inform character without defining them:**\n- Some are hardened and ruthless\n- Some are tender and protective\n- Some rage against injustice\n- Some just want to live normally\n\n### Geographic Considerations\n\n**Where a drow can exist openly:**\n- Veraheim (full freedom)\n- Broken Isles (practical freedom)\n- Nowhere else\n\n**Where a drow must hide:**\n- Thelassian (kill on sight)\n- Aloria (dangerous but survivable)\n- Anywhere Empire agents operate\n\n### Character Hooks\n\n| Background | Concept |\n|------------|---------|\n| **Veraheim native** | First generation to grow up free. What do you do with that privilege? |\n| **Escaped survivor** | Made the journey. Still have nightmares. Building a new life. |\n| **Cell operative** | Still connected to the underground. Your missions aren't over. |\n| **Passing** | Living as \"not-drow\" for years. Identity crisis. |\n| **Avenger** | You've decided survival isn't enough. You want justice. |\n| **Second generation** | Parents escaped; you've never known persecution directly. Do you understand? |\n\n### Relationships with Other Races\n\n| Race | Typical Relationship |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **High elves** | Enemy. Even exile elves might have complicated feelings. |\n| **Humans** | Varies. Some are allies; some are almost as bad as elves. |\n| **Other oppressed** | Solidarity. Drow understand persecution. |\n| **Thorongil** | Complex. A dragon bonded to their enemy. But he protects them now. |\n| **Vaelith** | Complicated hero. Uses drow causes for his own power. |\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Diaspora[\"🌙 The Drow Diaspora\"]\n        Veraheim_Drow[\"Veraheim<br/>(<100 citizens)\"]\n        Isles_Drow[\"Broken Isles<br/>(~500)\"]\n        Hidden[\"Underground Veleth<br/>(~2,500-3,500)\"]\n        Unknown[\"The Hidden City<br/>(??? - unknown)\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Organization[\"🕸️ Organization\"]\n        Cells[\"Cell Structure<br/>(compartmentalized)\"]\n        Elders[\"Elder Council<br/>(Veraheim)\"]\n        Vaelith[\"Vaelith's Network<br/>(Broken Isles)\"]\n    end\n\n    Empire[\"Thelassian\"] -->|\"400-year genocide\"| Hidden\n    Empire -.->|\"cannot reach\"| Veraheim_Drow\n    Empire -.->|\"cannot reach\"| Isles_Drow\n\n    Cells -->|\"enable\"| Hidden\n    Cells -->|\"smuggle to\"| Veraheim_Drow\n    Vaelith -->|\"funds/protects\"| Isles_Drow\n    Vaelith -.->|\"intelligence\"| Cells\n\n    Mirelen[\"Mirelen Dawnwhisper\"] -->|\"leads\"| Elders\n    Mirelen -->|\"advises\"| Vera[\"Vera Wyrdweaver\"]\n\n    style Empire fill:#f4cccc,color:#000\n    style Veraheim_Drow fill:#d9ead3,color:#000\n    style Hidden fill:#fff2cc,color:#000\n    style Cells fill:#d9d2e9,color:#000\n```\n\n---\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Drow Persecution](/peoples/drow-persecution) - The genocide's history\n- [Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) - The drow crime lord\n- [Mirelen Dawnwhisper](/npcs/mirelen-dawnwhisper) - Elder and advisor\n- [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) - The sanctuary\n- [The Broken Isles](/factions/the-broken-isles) - Alternative freedom\n- [The Elves-Dragon War](/history/the-elves-dragon-war) - What started it all\n\n---\n\n*\"We were a people before they tried to unmake us.
