  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nUnremarkable by design. Average height, average build, features that slide from memory moments after seeing him. Dresses in muted greys and deep blues—never the whites and silvers of the court. Moves silently, appears without warning, speaks softly.

Asks questions that seem innocent until you realize what you've revealed. Shows no emotion: not anger, not pleasure, not surprise. Some wonder if he feels anything at all.\n\n### Role & Methods\n- **Intelligence gathering**: Network of agents across the Empire and beyond\n- **Counter-espionage**: Identifying and neutralizing foreign spies\n- **Internal security**: Monitoring potential threats within the Empire\n- **Information control**: Deciding what the Emperor knows and when\n\n### Known Operations\nNo one knows his operations—that's the point.

He answers to none of them. This creates tension:\n- **Caerwyn**: Respects his effectiveness, dislikes his independence\n- **Thaelorin**: Uneasy alliance—Shadowmere provides information, expects records access\n- **Isileth**: Complicated—their domains overlap in foreign affairs\n- **Faendril**: Professional cooperation on economic intelligence\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nVelindor Shadowmere is exactly as dangerous as rumored—possibly more. He has served four roles across his career: assassin, spy, handler, and now spymaster. He has personally killed 47 elves and an unknown number of non-elves. He feels no guilt because he believes absolutely in the Empire's necessity.\n\nBut he is not a monster. He is a patriot who does monstrous things so others don't have to. He takes no pleasure in killing—it's simply a tool. He would sacrifice himself for the Empire without hesitation. He would sacrifice anyone else just as readily.\n\n### What He Actually Knows\n\n**About the Dragon War:**\nHis archives contain evidence that the drow experiments may have been sponsored by elven nobles seeking to control dragons. The drow were tools, not masterminds. He has never shared this with anyone—not even Valandor. The truth would destabilize everything.\n\n**About Thaelen's Defection:**\nHe knew Thaelen was falling in love with Vera. He could have intervened. He chose not to—partly as a test of Thaelen's loyalty, partly because he was curious what would happen. He considers this his greatest intelligence failure and his most interesting experiment.\n\n**About the Pillars:**\n- Caerwyn's secret sympathy for Thaelen\n- Thaelorin's hidden doubts about the drow policy\n- Isileth's prophetic visions she hasn't shared\n- Faendril's quiet reforms in the Office of Lesser Peoples\n\n**About Veraheim:**\nHe has agents in Veraheim. He's had agents there for 80 years. Vera suspects but can't prove it. He's genuinely impressed by what she's built. In another life, he might have admired her openly.\n\n### His Network\n- **The Whispered**: Elite agents, deep cover operatives\n- **The Listeners**: Information gatherers, not operatives\n- **The Forgotten**: Sleeper agents, activated only for critical missions\n- **The Dead**: Agents who \"died\" and now operate with new identities\n\n### What He Wants\n- The Empire's security and stability\n- To know everything (knowledge is control)\n- A worthy successor (hasn't found one in 400 years)\n- Perhaps: to understand why Thaelen chose love over duty\n\n### What He Fears\n- A secret he doesn't know exists\n- His network being compromised\n- Dying before training a replacement\n- The Dragon War truth emerging without his control\n\n### The Question He Can't Answer\nWhy does he serve? He's had opportunities to seize power, to become a Pillar, to manipulate the Emperor. He's chosen not to. Is it loyalty? Duty? Habit? After 400 years, he's not sure anymore.\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Recruitment** | Shadowmere approaches a PC. He wants them for a mission. Refusing has consequences. |\n| **The Leak** | Someone is feeding information to enemies. Shadowmere suspects a Pillar. He needs outside investigators. |\n| **The Defector** | One of his agents wants out. They know too much to simply leave. |\n| **The Truth** | He decides to reveal the Dragon War secret—but only to PCs who can handle it. |\n| **The Succession** | He's dying (poison? age? magical disease?) and needs to choose a successor. Fast. |\n| **The Veraheim File** | His dossier on Veraheim goes missing. Someone took it. Who? Why? |\n\n---",
