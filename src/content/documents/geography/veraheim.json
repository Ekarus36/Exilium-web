  "commonKnowledge": "### The City's Geography\n\nVeraheim exists within a massive fissure—a mountain split north-to-south by Vera's power 80 years ago. The city is carved into the canyon walls, 500 feet above ground level.\n\n**Three Levels:**\n- **Ground Level (0 ft)**: Harbor, tunnel entrances, lift bases\n- **City Level (500 ft)**: The main city, all districts, residences\n- **Summit (700+ ft)**: Thorongil's perch, observation posts\n\n**The Three Lifts** (only access):\n- **East Lift**: Faces Aloria, moderate traffic. [Copperhill](/geography/copperhill) sits at the base—a waystation for commuters and merchants.\n- **West Lift**: Faces Thelassian, light traffic (elves reluctant)\n- **South Lift**: Harbor access, busiest (cargo from ships)\n\nEach lift platform has 10 guards. The lifts are magically powered and can be disabled instantly.\n\n### The Tunnel\n\nBelow the city, at ground level, runs the **only safe trade route** between east and west. The tunnel passes through the mountain, with branches to the harbor. Veraheim collects tolls on all commercial traffic—this is the city's economic lifeline.\n\nBoth powers hate paying, but the alternatives (mountain passes, sea routes) are too dangerous or slow.\n\n### The Contribution System\n\nVeraheim has no nobility, no inherited wealth, no racial hierarchy. Status comes from **contribution**.\n\n**Contributors receive housing:**\n- Artisans (smiths, tailors, carpenters)\n- Certified apprentices\n- City workers (guards, cleaners, officials)\n- Merchants employing 8+ workers\n\n**Non-contributors must find other arrangements:**\n- Small shopkeepers pay rent\n- Laborers find lodging where they can\n- Those who can't contribute leave by sunset\n\n**The Artisan Challenges**: Every 5 years, competitions determine who holds the 5 licensed shops for each profession. Skill wins. Connections don't.\n\n### The Guard\n\n**300 total guards** under Thaelen's command, working 4 shifts of 75:\n- 30 guards at the three lifts (10 each)\n- 30 guards in city districts\n- 12 at watch stations\n- 3 command officers per shift\n\nThe guard is diverse—humans, elves, half-orcs, drow—reflecting the city's population. They answer to Thaelen, who answers to no one but Vera.\n\n### The Floating Docks\n\nNot everyone makes it into the city. Off the harbor, a floating settlement of lashed-together boats holds those who can't contribute—refugees, the desperate, the criminal. Veraheim's guards don't patrol there. Three gangs run it. People die.\n\nVera knows. She hasn't fixed it.\n\n### Relations\n\n**Thelassian**: Views Vera as a criminal enchantress who stole their last dragon rider. Needs the tunnel. Hates needing it.\n\n**Aloria**: Resents losing their greatest sorceress. Some lords dream of conquest. All use the tunnel.\n\n**Drow**: The only safe place in the world for them. Many hide here. Veraheim doesn't enforce the Empire's kill-on-sight policy.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Truth About the Founding\n\nThe official story: Vera and Thaelen fell in love saving lives, then created a sanctuary when both powers rejected them.\n\n**The darker truth**: Vera didn't just split the mountain—she killed people doing it. Imperial soldiers and Kingdom knights who came to capture them. The death toll was never recorded. Vera doesn't talk about it. Thaelen was horrified but stayed.\n\nThe city is built on blood. The founders know it.\n\n### The Lift Vulnerability\n\nThe lifts are powered by Vera's magic, anchored to her life force. If Vera dies:\n- The lifts stop working within hours\n- The city becomes inaccessible\n- 3,500 people are trapped 500 feet up\n\nThaelen knows this. He's terrified of it. They have no succession plan. Vera is human. She'll die eventually. Then what?\n\n**Potential plot**: Someone discovers this vulnerability. Assassination attempts on Vera become existential threats to the entire city.\n\n### The Floating Docks Problem\n\nVera hasn't cleaned up the Floating Docks because **she can't without betraying her principles**:\n- Forcing people into the city violates contribution requirements\n- Military action against the gangs requires resources she won't spare from defense\n- The Docks serve as a pressure valve—without them, desperate people would riot at the lifts\n\nShe tells herself it's pragmatism. It's actually guilt. She built a perfect city that can only hold 3,500 people, and she doesn't know what to do about the rest.\n\n**Secret fear**: The Floating Docks are what Veraheim's idealism actually produces—the people who fall through the cracks.\n\n### Thaelen's Guilt\n\nThaelen commanded Dragon Knights. Forty-seven of them died in the Dragon War. He's the only survivor with an intact bond.\n\nHe didn't defect just for love. He defected because he couldn't face his people anymore. Every time he sees an elf in Veraheim, he wonders if they lost family to the war he survived.\n\n**His brother** [Maethor Ruincalen](/npcs/maethor-ruincalen) still lives in the Empire, disgraced because of Thaelen's defection. They haven't spoken in 80 years. Thaelen sends no messages. He's ashamed.\n\n### Thorongil's Secret\n\nThe dragon loves Vera as much as Thaelen. This is unusual—dragons bond with one rider, tolerating others at best. Thorongil genuinely chose to protect both of them.\n\n**Why?** Thorongil saw something in Vera that reminded him of dragons. Her rage when she split the mountain. Her willingness to burn everything for the one she loved. He recognized a kindred spirit.\n\nIf Vera died, Thorongil might not leave. He might stay to protect what she built. Or he might burn both empires in grief. Even Thaelen doesn't know which.\n\n### Hidden Tensions\n\n**The Contribution System's Flaw**: It works for skilled workers. It fails for the elderly, the disabled, the traumatized. These people either fake contributions, rely on others' charity, or end up on the Floating Docks. The system has no safety net because Vera believes everyone can contribute *something*. She's wrong, but she won't admit it.\n\n**Guard Loyalty**: The guards serve Thaelen, but some wonder what happens when he's gone. He's an elf—he'll outlive Vera by centuries. Will he stay? Will he return to the Empire? No one asks him directly.\n\n**Spy Networks**: Both the Empire and Kingdom have agents in Veraheim. [Velindor Shadowmere](/npcs/velindor-shadowmere) (Empire's spymaster) has had operatives here for 80 years. The Kingdom's are less organized but present. Vera knows. She tolerates it because expelling them would require the surveillance state she refuses to build.\n\n### The Succession Search\n\nVera knows she's mortal. The lifts are tied to her life force. When she dies, 3,500 people are trapped.\n\nShe's been searching for a successor since the beginning.\n\n**Thorongil's Gift**\n\nThe dragon has a sixth sense for raw magical power—he can feel sorcerers, those born with innate magic rather than trained wizards. Whenever he senses potential, he tells Vera directly. They speak regularly, sometimes telepathically, sometimes during her evening visits to his perch.\n\nShe tests everyone he finds. Most disappoint.\n\n**The Apprentices**\n\nThere are always one or two sorcerers training under Vera. Those who lack sufficient power learn what they can—enchanting, ward maintenance—before moving on to other roles in the city. Those with real potential train harder. Vera pushes them, looking for ways to grow their power.\n\nThe current apprentices compete fiercely with each other and guard their positions jealously. A newcomer with greater potential would threaten everything they've worked for.\n\n*Note: Create 1-2 current apprentice NPCs. Their rivalry and reaction to potential newcomers is a ready-made plot hook.*\n\n**The Two Paths**\n\nVera thinks like a sorcerer. She knows one way to solve problems: raw power. So she pursues two options:\n\n1. **Find the right person** - A sorcerer with enough innate power to sustain the lifts\n2. **Find the right artifact** - An item that could grant someone the power they lack\n\nOthers have suggested alternatives—engineering, distributed magical systems, emergency measures. Vera listens politely. None of these are proven either, and she'd rather pursue the solution she understands.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Succession Crisis** | Vera falls ill. Panic spreads. Who controls the lifts if she dies? |\n| **Floating Docks Uprising** | The gangs unite. They want into the city.
