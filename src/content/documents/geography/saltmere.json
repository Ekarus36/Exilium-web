  "commonKnowledge": "### Geography\n\nBuilt around a crescent bay on Tidecaller Island. Docks stretch along the entire waterfront. The city climbs gentle hills behind the harbor. Always busy—ships coming and going constantly.\n\n**Key Areas:**\n- **The Crescent**: Main harbor, dozens of berths\n- **Market Hill**: Where the major markets cluster\n- **The Counting Houses**: Financial district, banks, moneylenders\n- **The Sprawl**: Dense commercial/residential district\n- **The Salts**: Lower district, rougher area, cheaper lodging\n\n### The Saltcouncil\n\nSeven merchants rule Saltmere:\n- **First Merchant** (chair) + **Six Councilors**\n- Seats effectively purchased (must own significant business)\n- Gold speaks; they listen\n- Politics and morality secondary to profit\n\n**Current First Merchant**: Delara Silvertongue (human woman, 45), former Kingdom merchant who fled scandal. Brilliant negotiator, utterly amoral.\n\n### What's Traded\n\n**From the Isles:**\n- Ships and repairs (Skarath)\n- Weapons and metal goods (Ironhold)\n- Food and bonecraft (Stormcrag)\n- Monster parts and relics (Mistwood)\n- Plundered cargo (Freehold)\n\n**From Outside:**\n- Kingdom goods (secretly)\n- Empire luxuries (very secretly)\n- Distant exotic imports\n- Information and secrets\n\n### The Markets\n\n**The Grand Exchange**: Legitimate goods, major transactions, auction house.\n\n**The Midnight Market**: Opens after dark, no questions asked, stolen goods, contraband.\n\n**The Whisper Market**: Not a place—a network. Information brokering, secrets, blackmail material. Find the right person and anything can be learned.\n\n### Banking\n\nSaltmere has actual banks—the Counting Houses. They hold deposits, make loans, and facilitate large transactions. Letters of credit from Saltmere are accepted (cautiously) even in the mainland.\n\n**The Iron Vault**: Largest bank, run by hobgoblin expatriates. Absolutely secure. Never been robbed.\n\n### Laws\n\nSimple: **Don't disrupt trade.**\n- Violence that scares away merchants? Punished.\n- Theft from fellow traders? Punished.\n- Cheating customers? Punished (bad for reputation).\n- Murder, slavery, smuggling? Only illegal if it affects business.\n\nThe Harbor Guard (200 mercenaries) enforces the Council's will.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### Delara's Network\n\nFirst Merchant Delara Silvertongue isn't just a trader—she's the best information broker in the Isles. The Whisper Market answers to her.\n\n**What she knows:**\n- Which Kingdom lords secretly trade with pirates\n- Which Empire merchants are embezzling\n- Shipping schedules for both major powers\n- Blackmail material on half the Saltcouncil\n\n**What she wants:** Security. She fled the Kingdom after exposing a lord's corruption. He wants her dead. She's built Saltmere into her fortress—and her intelligence network into her shield.\n\n### The Kingdom Connection\n\nThree Kingdom lords maintain secret trading relationships through Saltmere intermediaries:\n- **Lord Belmont**: Buys stolen goods at discount, sells as \"salvage\"\n- **Lord Blackthorne**: Funds specific pirate captains to raid rivals\n- **Lord Ashfeld**: Trades information about shipping for cuts of pirate profit\n\nIf exposed, all three would be ruined. Delara has documentation on all of them.\n\n### The Empire Presence\n\nThe Thelassian officially has no contact with the Broken Isles. Unofficially:\n- Two elven merchants operate in Saltmere under assumed identities\n- They buy back stolen Imperial goods (quietly)\n- They report shipping intelligence to [Velindor Shadowmere](/npcs/velindor-shadowmere)\n- They've been here for 40 years\n\n### [Nix Quickfingers](/npcs/boss-nix-quickfingers)\n\nThe halfling information broker works out of Saltmere. She appears to be Delara's subordinate. In truth, they're partners—and Nix has her own agenda.\n\n**Nix's secret**: She's building a network to eventually challenge The Storm's information monopoly. She believes knowledge is the only power that matters. Delara knows and approves. They're playing a very long game.\n\n### The Storm's Interest\n\n[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) doesn't care about Saltmere's politics—but he cares very much about its information. He has an arrangement with Delara: she shares intelligence; he leaves her alone.\n\n**What he doesn't know**: Delara and Nix are slowly building capabilities to operate without his permission. They're not enemies—just preparing for a future where The Storm is gone.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Blackmail Files** | Someone stole documents from Delara. Kingdom lords are panicking. Find the thief before war breaks out. |\n| **The Imperial Agents** | The elven merchants' cover is blown. Extract them or expose them? |\n| **The New Bank** | A rival Counting House is opening. The Iron Vault wants it stopped. Legally or otherwise. |\n| **The Whisper Market** | Someone's selling information about PCs' past. Find the source. |\n| **Lord Belmont's Problem** | His pirate connection is becoming liability. He needs it severed—permanently and secretly. |\n| **The Information War** | Nix needs allies for her long game against The Storm's network. Is this wise? |\n\n### The Saltcouncil's Corruption\n\nEvery councilor has secrets:\n- **Merchant Vorn** (hobgoblin): Embezzling from the Harbor Guard fund\n- **Merchant Tessara** (human): Owns slaves she claims are \"servants\"\n- **Merchant Grimbold** (dwarf): Fencing goods from a recent massacre\n- **Merchant Silka** (half-elf): Imperial agent (yes, on the Council)\n- **Merchant Krag** (orc): Legitimate, but owes massive debts to the Iron Vault\n- **Delara**: Knows all of the above; uses it to maintain control\n\n---",
