  "commonKnowledge": "### The Four Paths to Citizenship\n\n#### 1. Win a Craftsman Competition\n\nEvery **4 years**, competitions determine who holds the licensed shops for each profession. Anyone can enter—refugees from the Floats, visitors from the Kingdom, even elves from the Empire.\n\n- **5 winners per profession** receive the main shops\n- Winners hire helpers, apprentices, and staff\n- Competition is open, judged on skill alone\n- Winning = immediate citizenship with housing\n\n#### 2. Get Hired by a Shop Winner\n\nCraftsman winners control jobs with housing allocation. If they hire you:\n\n| Phase | Duration | Status |\n|-------|----------|--------|\n| **Probation** | First 6 months | Temporary housing, can be dismissed |\n| **Application** | After 6 months | Apply for full residency |\n| **Citizenship** | Upon approval | Permanent housing, full rights |\n\nThis protects winners from bad hires—they must vouch for you for 6 months before you can apply.\n\n#### 3. Join the Guard\n\nThe guard (300 total) has constant turnover—deaths, retirements, departures. Recruitment is ongoing.\n\n- Pass physical requirements\n- Pass background assessment\n- Get assigned = job with housing = citizenship\n\n#### 4. Other City-Approved Jobs\n\nEvery job designated \"contributor status\" follows the same structure:\n\n- Lift operators and maintenance\n- City administrators and clerks\n- Tax collectors and record keepers\n- Sanitation and road maintenance\n- Warehouse supervisors\n- Inn and tavern operators (licensed)\n\nIf the position comes with housing allocation, it's a path to citizenship.\n\n### Day Workers (Not Citizens)\n\nMany people work in Veraheim without living there:\n\n**From the Floating Docks:**\n- ~200 day workers ascend each morning\n- Earn 3-8 copper/day\n- Must leave by sunset bell\n- No housing, no residency\n- Some save toward permanent positions\n- Some prefer the arrangement\n\n**From Human Lands:**\n- Workers from nearby Ashfeld settlements\n- Enter via East Lift\n- Same sunset rule\n- Regular trade relationships\n\n**From Elven Lands (rare):**\n- Elves rarely seek work in Veraheim\n- Those who do are often exiles\n- Enter via West Lift\n- Watched more carefully\n\n### Families\n\nWhen a contributor gains citizenship:\n\n| Family Member | Status |\n|---------------|--------|\n| **Spouse** | Automatic residency under contributor's housing |\n| **Children** | Automatic residency |\n| **Elderly parents** | Covered under family support |\n| **Adult relatives** | Expected to find own contribution eventually |\n\n### Losing Citizenship\n\nCitizenship can be revoked for:\n- Failing to contribute (losing job without finding another)\n- Serious criminal behavior\n- Betraying the city\n\nRevocation means: Leave by sunset. Most end up on the Floats.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Unofficial Background Check\n\nVeraheim has no formal immigration process—but new citizens don't go unexamined.\n\n**What happens:**\n- Thaelen's guard quietly investigates newcomers\n- Vera's network of contacts provides information\n- The drow community shares what they know about refugees\n- Employers are expected to vouch for their hires\n\n**What they look for:**\n- Spies from the Empire or Kingdom\n- Agents with hidden agendas\n- Criminals fleeing justice elsewhere\n- Anyone who might harm the city\n\n**How it works:**\n- No forms, no records, no formal process\n- Discreet observation during the 6-month probation\n- Word spreads fast in a city of 3,500\n- Most threats are identified and quietly removed\n\n**Effectiveness:** Very high. The combination of small community, 6-month probation, and informal networks catches most problems before they become serious.\n\n### Why the 6-Month Probation Works\n\nThe probation period serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. **Security screening**: Time to investigate backgrounds\n2. **Skill verification**: Confirm the person can actually do the job\n3. **Community integration**: See if they fit Veraheim's culture\n4. **Employer accountability**: Winners risk their reputation on bad hires\n\nIf someone is rejected after probation, their employer loses credibility. This makes employers careful about who they hire in the first place.\n\n### The Competition System (Hidden Details)\n\n**Who judges:**\n- Panel of master craftsmen (previous winners, now retired or moved on)\n- City officials ensure fairness\n- Vera occasionally observes personally\n\n**What's really being judged:**\n- Skill (primary)\n- Innovation and creativity\n- Reliability and character (observed over competition period)\n- Whether they'll be good employers\n\n**Manipulation attempts:**\n- Bribes are occasionally tried (usually caught)\n- Sabotage happens (severely punished)\n- The system is remarkably clean—Vera's reputation depends on it\n\n### The Floating Docks Connection\n\nThe citizenship system creates the Floats. People end up there when:\n\n- They can't find an approved job\n- They fail probation\n- They lose citizenship\n- They're waiting for competition years\n- They're saving for a shot at entry\n\n**The path out:**\n1. Do day labor in the city\n2. Get noticed by an employer\n3. Get offered a permanent position\n4. Survive 6-month probation\n5. Apply for full residency\n6. Become a citizen\n\n**The odds:** Maybe 10-15% of Floats residents eventually make it into the city. The rest stay, leave, or die there.\n\n### Vera's Guilt\n\nThe citizenship system is Vera's creation. She designed it to ensure everyone contributes—and it works. Veraheim functions because no one freeloads.\n\nBut she knows the cost. Every person on the Floats is someone her system rejected. Every child who drowns out there is a failure of her idealism.\n\nShe won't change the system—it works too well. But she funds Mama Kresh's Haven anonymously, ensures the water barge never runs dry, and watches the Floats from her window every night.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Probation Sabotage** | Someone is deliberately causing new hires to fail probation. Rival guild? Empire spy? Personal grudge? |\n| **Competition Rigging** | Evidence surfaces that a past competition was rigged. If true, current shop holders are illegitimate. |\n| **The Desperate Hire** | A Floats family begs a shop winner to hire them. The winner is reluctant—bad experience with past hires. Convince them? |\n| **The Background Check** | The PCs are asked to quietly investigate a new hire. What they find is complicated. |\n| **Six Months** | A PC or NPC they care about is in probation. Someone wants them to fail. |\n\n---",

It's a meritocracy.\n\n- Everyone who lives here contributes\n- Contribution is rewarded with housing and security\n- Those who can't contribute (elderly, disabled) are supported by family or earned retirement benefits\n- Those who **won't** contribute have no place here\n\nThis is why Veraheim works. 3,500 people, all pulling their weight.\n\nThis is also why the Floating Docks exist—the price of idealism.\n\n---\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) - City overview\n- [Veraheim - City Layout](/geography/veraheim-city-layout-structure) - Housing tiers and structure\n- [The Floating Docks](/geography/the-floating-docks) - Where those who can't contribute end up\n- [Veraheim - Demographics](/geography/veraheim-demographics-racial-composition) - Who lives in the city\n\n---\n\n*\"The mountain doesn't care about your story.
