  "rawContent": "# Vaelithra Farseer\n\n**Oracle of Stars** | Special Position\n\n> *\"I do not see the future. I see futures. Which one comes... that is still being written.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | Unknown (ancient, possibly 1,000+) |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Female |\n| **Role** | Imperial Seer, Prophetic Advisor |\n| **Reports To** | Emperor Valandor (when she chooses) |\n| **Location** | Unknown (appears when needed) |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nVaelithra Farseer is the Empire's oracle—an ancient seer who provides prophetic guidance on matters of great importance. She appears rarely, speaks cryptically, and vanishes without explanation. Her predictions have proven accurate often enough that even skeptics listen when she speaks.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nDistant, ethereal, not quite present. Speaks in fragments, metaphors, and visions. Seems to see through people rather than at them. Neither friendly nor hostile—simply elsewhere, perceiving things others cannot. Conversations with her leave lasting unease.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Has advised every Emperor (all one of them) for unknown centuries\n- Appears perhaps once per decade, always at critical moments\n- Her prophecies are recorded but rarely understood until after events\n- No one knows where she lives or how to summon her\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nShe has seen the end of the Empire. Multiple endings—some peaceful, some catastrophic. She doesn't share this because knowing the end doesn't help change it. She watches to see which ending is coming. She hopes for the peaceful ones.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Emperor Valandor**: Advisor - The only one she consistently speaks to\n- **Isileth**: Professional - The Starwarden studies her prophecies\n- **The Future**: Her true companion - She lives there more than the present\n",
