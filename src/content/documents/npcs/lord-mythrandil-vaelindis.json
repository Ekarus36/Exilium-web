  "rawContent": "# Lord Mythrandil Vaelindis\n\n**Head of House Vaelindis** | Twilight Quadrant (Diplomatic Nobility)\n\n> *\"Every marriage is an alliance. Every alliance is a marriage. Choose wisely.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 520 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Male |\n| **Role** | Great House Lord, Diplomatic Patriarch |\n| **Aligned Pillar** | Twilight Tower (Twilight Assembly) |\n| **Location** | Vaelindis Estate, Inner City |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nHouse Vaelindis has married into every major noble family over 600 years. They don't fight wars or argue law—they build relationships. Lord Mythrandil knows everyone's secrets, everyone's ambitions, and everyone's leverage. His house's power is invisible but pervasive.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nCharming, cultured, dangerously perceptive. Makes everyone feel like his closest friend while calculating their usefulness. Never threatens—just reminds. Hosts legendary gatherings where alliances form and break. The most pleasant knife in Aelindor.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Related by marriage to all three other Great Houses\n- Has connections in the Aloria nobility (through distant arrangements)\n- Hosts the annual Twilight Ball—attendance is political necessity\n- Children and grandchildren strategically placed throughout court\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nOne of his granddaughters fell in love with a human merchant 30 years ago. He helped her disappear—officially she \"died of illness.\" She lives in Veraheim now. He sends money through untraceable channels. Family is family, even when it's inconvenient.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Isileth**: Political ally - Diplomatic families support diplomatic Pillar\n- **All Great Houses**: Marriage ties - Related to everyone somehow\n- **Velindor Shadowmere**: Cautious respect - Both deal in information\n",
