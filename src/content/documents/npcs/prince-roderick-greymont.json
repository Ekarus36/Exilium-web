  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nTall, broad-shouldered, warrior's build. Handsome in an aggressive way. Dark hair worn longer than his father likes. Mother's green eyes, but harder. Dresses martially—always ready for a fight. Confident posture, direct gaze, firm handshake that's slightly too firm.\n\n### Personality\nBrave to the point of recklessness. Impatient with politics and scheming. Believes firmly in human supremacy—non-humans are lesser beings to him. Charismatic with soldiers, awkward with courtiers. Short temper, holds grudges. Wants to be a conqueror-king like the legends.\n\n### Family Tensions\nConstant conflict with his father over policy. Roderick thinks Aldric's diplomacy is weakness. He wants action: attack Veraheim, push back the elves, expand human dominion. Aldric keeps restraining him, which Roderick resents deeply.\n\n### Public Activities\n- Trains constantly, often with the Royal Guard\n- Attends tournaments, usually wins\n- Drinks with Lord Eisenwald and Lord Blackthorne\n- Gives speeches about human glory that soldiers love\n- Avoids council meetings when possible\n\n### Marriage Situation\nAt 28, still unmarried—unusual for a Crown Prince. Every Lord wants the connection. Father keeps delaying, citing \"finding the right match.\" Roderick doesn't care about marriage; he cares about glory.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nRoderick is not stupid—he's impatient and ideologically blinded. He genuinely believes humans are superior and that strength is the only virtue that matters. He loves his father but can't respect his methods. He desperately wants Aldric's approval and will never admit it.\n\n### The Father Wound\nDeep down, Roderick knows he disappoints his father. Aldric rarely praises him. Every political lecture feels like criticism. Roderick responds by doubling down on what he's good at (fighting) and rejecting what he's bad at (politics). This is slowly destroying their relationship.\n\n### Dangerous Influences\n- **Lord Eisenwald:** Cultivating Roderick, teaching him that military strength is true power. Wants Roderick to remember his \"friends\" when he's King.\n- **Lord Blackthorne:** Drinking companion, feeding Roderick's worst impulses. Edmund sees Roderick as a useful tool—an aggressive King is easier to manipulate.\n- **The Military Faction:** Young officers who share his views, forming a faction that will support him when he takes power.\n\n### The Veraheim Obsession\nRoderick genuinely believes attacking Veraheim would be:\n- Glorious (reclaiming human dominion)\n- Easy (it's just one city)\n- Popular (everyone secretly wants it)\n\nHe's wrong on all counts. Vera's magic, Thorongil's power, and the Broken Isles alliance would crush any assault. Aldric knows this; Roderick won't listen.\n\n### What He Actually Wants\n- His father's respect (will never admit this)\n- To be remembered as a great king\n- Military glory and conquest\n- To prove human supremacy through action\n\n### What He Fears\n- Being seen as weak\n- Becoming his father (a \"mere\" politician)\n- Never getting his chance at glory\n- That his father might be right\n\n### When He Becomes King\nIf Aldric dies and Roderick takes the throne:\n- He'll likely attack Veraheim within the first year\n- He'll promote the military Lords (Eisenwald, Wolfstein)\n- He'll sideline the political Lords (Belmont, Königsford)\n- Edmund Blackthorne will have significant influence\n- The Kingdom may not survive his reign\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Reckless Plan** | Roderick is planning something without his father's knowledge. Stop him or help him? |\n| **The Prince's Favor** | Roderick takes interest in the PCs. His patronage comes with expectations. |\n| **Father and Son** | Aldric asks the PCs to moderate Roderick.
