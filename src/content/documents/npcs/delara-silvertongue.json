  "secretKnowledge": "### Her Past\n\n**The truth about her flight from the Kingdom:**\n\nDelara was born into minor merchant nobility. She discovered that Lord Erickson (a mid-tier lord, now dead) was embezzling from the crown through falsified trade records. She exposed him—naively believing the system would reward honesty.\n\n**What happened:**\n- Erickson was executed\n- His family swore revenge\n- Three assassination attempts in two years\n- She fled to the only place Kingdom justice couldn't reach\n\n**What she learned:** The system doesn't reward honesty. It rewards leverage.\n\n### The Whisper Market\n\nDelara runs the Broken Isles' premier intelligence operation. The Whisper Market isn't a place—it's her network.\n\n**What she controls:**\n- Information brokers throughout Saltmere\n- Agents in the Aloria (merchants, servants)\n- Limited Empire contacts (through intermediaries)\n- Files on every significant player in the Isles\n\n**Her partner:** [Nix Quickfingers](/npcs/boss-nix-quickfingers), the halfling information broker. They present as employer-subordinate. Actually, they're partners building something bigger.\n\n### The Kingdom Connections\n\nThree Aloria lords maintain secret trading relationships through Saltmere:\n\n**Lord Belmont:** Buys \"salvage\" (stolen goods) at discount, resells at profit. Delara has documented proof.\n\n**Lord Blackthorne:** Funds specific pirate captains to raid his rivals' shipping. Delara has the payment records.\n\n**Lord Ashfeld:** Trades shipping schedules for percentage of pirate profits. Delara has the correspondence.\n\n**What this means:** Delara has blackmail leverage over three major lords. She hasn't used it—yet. Leverage unused is leverage preserved.\n\n### The Storm Arrangement\n\n[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) and Delara have an understanding:\n- She shares intelligence with him\n- He leaves Saltmere independent\n- Neither fully trusts the other\n- Both benefit from the arrangement\n\n**What he doesn't know:** Delara and Nix are slowly building capabilities to operate without his permission. Not against him—just independent. When The Storm eventually falls (everyone does), Saltmere will be ready.\n\n### Her Goals\n\n**Short-term:**\n- Maintain Saltmere's neutrality and prosperity\n- Expand intelligence network\n- Stay alive (Erickson's descendants still want her dead)\n\n**Long-term:**\n- Build enough leverage to be untouchable\n- Create information infrastructure that survives her\n- Eventually, make Saltmere the true power in the Isles\n\n### The Saltcouncil Secrets\n\nDelara controls the Council through knowledge:\n\n| Councilor | Secret | Status |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Vorn (hobgoblin) | Embezzling from Harbor Guard | Manageable |\n| Tessara (human) | Owns hidden slaves | Controlled |\n| Grimbold (dwarf) | Fencing massacre goods | Watched |\n| Silka (half-elf) | Imperial agent | Known, useful |\n| Krag (orc) | Massive Iron Vault debts | Sympathized |\n\nShe doesn't blackmail them openly—she just makes sure they know she knows. Compliance follows naturally.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Blackmail Files** | Someone stole Delara's documentation. Kingdom lords panic. Find the thief. |\n| **The Old Enemy** | Erickson's grandson has found her. Assassination incoming—unless she strikes first. |\n| **The Imperial Agent** | Silka's cover is blown. Extract, eliminate, or expose? |\n| **The Storm's Test** | Vaelith suspects Delara's building independent capabilities. He wants proof—or reassurance. |\n| **The Partner's Play** | Nix has made a move without telling Delara. Is the partnership still solid? |\n| **The Network Job** | Delara needs something investigated. She'll pay in gold—or information. |\n\n---",
