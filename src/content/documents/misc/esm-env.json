  "rawContent": "# esm-env\n\nUses export conditions to return environment information in a way that works with major bundlers and runtimes.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall with `npm install esm-env`, then import as needed:\n\n```js\nimport { BROWSER, DEV, NODE } from 'esm-env';\n```\n\nSpecify `conditions` in your bundler or runtime. For example:\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-c-condition---conditionscondition)\n- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/modules#custom-conditions)\n- [Vite/Vitest](https://vite.dev/config/shared-options#resolve-conditions)\n- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveconditionnames)\n\nIf `esm-env` is used in both bundled code and an externalized library, you will need to specify conditions both at build-time and run-time.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThank you to [dominikg](https://github.com/dominikg) for refining the approach used by this library to suggest a more scalable method for adding additional conditions.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n",
