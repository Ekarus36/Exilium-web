Veraheim counts everyone.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Type** | Reference Document |\n| **Scope** | Languages, education, and festivals across major cultures |\n| **Related** | [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian), [Aloria](/factions/aloria), [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) |\n\n---\n\n## Languages\n\n### The Common Tongue\n\nA trade language that emerged from centuries of commerce through Veraheim. Functions like English in our world—widespread but not universal.\n\n**Who speaks it:**\n- Merchants, travelers, diplomats: fluent\n- Border populations: fluent\n- Urban populations: conversational\n- Isolated communities: little to none\n\n### Elvish (Thelassian)\n\nThe native language of the Thelassian. Ancient, complex, and deliberately difficult to master.\n\n**Common as a second language:**\n- Elves who travel or work borders: fluent\n- Most other elves: conversational with heavy accent\n- Scholars and diplomats: fluent\n- Average elf: can communicate but it's clearly a second language\n\n*Elves consider Common a \"practical necessity\" rather than a language worth mastering.*\n\n### Human Tongues (Aloria)\n\nThe eleven domains have regional dialects, but a shared Alorian language unites the kingdom.\n\n**Common proficiency:**\n- Traders and travelers: fluent\n- Urban populations: functional\n- Rural peasants: limited to none\n- Lords and nobles: fluent (required for diplomacy)\n\n### Drow\n\nA dialect of Elvish that diverged centuries ago. Includes:\n- Silent hand signs for covert communication\n- Rarely written (evidence is dangerous)\n- Speaking it openly marks you as drow\n\n---\n\n## Education\n\n### Thelassian (Elves)\n\n*See [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian) for the full elven learning system.*\n\nElves learn across decades, not years. Apprenticeships last longer than human lifetimes. Mastery is expected, not exceptional.\n\n### Aloria (Humans)\n\n**No formal education system.** Learning happens through:\n\n**Apprenticeships:**\n- Children work young, learn by doing\n- Skills passed from master to apprentice\n- Getting your child placed with a good master requires connections\n- Literacy is rare outside nobility and clergy\n\n**For the privileged:**\n- Noble children have tutors\n- A few masters take exceptional students\n- Magic training exists but is separate (see <span class=\"broken-link\" title=\"Page not found: Magic in Aloria\">Magic in Aloria</span>)\n\n**The reality:** Most Alorians can't read. They learn their trade, their prayers, and their place.\n\n### Veraheim\n\n**Minimum education is mandatory.** Every citizen's child attends school.\n\n**Core requirements (roughly equivalent to age 12 skills):**\n- Reading and writing\n- Basic mathematics\n- Veraheim history and governance\n- City rules and regulations\n- Festival traditions and customs\n\n**For late arrivals:**\n- Adults who join as citizens receive placement assessment\n- Those below minimum get special tutoring\n- A dedicated facility exists for adult education\n- No shame in it—many refugees never had the chance to learn\n\n**The philosophy:** Veraheim functions because everyone can read a contract, count their coin, and understand the laws. Ignorance breeds exploitation.\n\n---\n\n## Festivals and Celebrations\n\n### Thelassian Festivals\n\n**Elves do not celebrate yearly.** Their festivals follow longer cycles—decades, not seasons.\n\n**Key differences from human celebrations:**\n- A \"festival\" may last a week or a month\n- Tied to celestial events, historical anniversaries, or life milestones\n- Not predictable to outsiders\n- Deep ritual significance\n\n**Common types:**\n- Remembrance periods (honoring the dead, may last weeks)\n- Mastery celebrations (when an elf completes a century of study)\n- Celestial alignments (rare astronomical events)\n- The Long Silence (mourning period after great loss—can last years)\n\n*Humans find elven festivals confusing. \"Is it still going? Did it end? Are they sad or celebrating?\"*\n\n### Alorian Festivals\n\n**Humans celebrate in familiar cycles.** Yearly, seasonal, predictable.\n\n**Seasonal festivals:**\n- **First Thaw** (spring): End of winter, planting begins\n- **High Sun** (summer): Longest day, midsummer celebrations\n- **Harvest Home** (autumn): The main celebration—feasting, gratitude\n- **Long Night** (winter): Shortest day, candles against the dark\n\n**Royal observances:**\n- **Coronation Day**: Anniversary of the current King's crowning\n- **Founding Day**: Celebrates the Kingdom's establishment\n\n**Religious holidays:**\n- One or two major holy days depending on region and patron deity\n- Varies by domain—Thornwood celebrates different gods than Eisenwald\n\n### Veraheim Festivals\n\n**Veraheim has its own traditions**, blending influences:\n\n- **Founding Day**: Celebrates Vera and Thaelen's establishment of the sanctuary\n- **Tunnel Opening**: Commemorates when trade began flowing\n- **The Welcoming**: A monthly celebration of new citizens (small, community-focused)\n- Residents also observe their own cultural festivals privately\n\n---\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian) - Elven culture and education\n- [Aloria](/factions/aloria) - Human culture\n- [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) - The neutral sanctuary\n- [Drow Culture and Society](/peoples/drow-culture-and-society) - Drow language and traditions\n\n---\n\n*\"An elf's festival lasts longer than a human's education.
