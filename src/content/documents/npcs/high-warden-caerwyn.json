Commands respect through competence earned across centuries.\n\n### Military Philosophy\n- **Intimidation over conflict:** Show overwhelming force to avoid battle\n- **Strategic strikes:** Not prolonged campaigns\n- **Preservation of elven lives:** Every soldier is irreplaceable\n- **Win before fighting:** The best victory is the one never fought\n\n### The Dragon Knights\nCommands what remains of the legendary order:\n- **Before:** Dragon riders who bonded with dragons\n- **After the War:** Elite warriors without dragon bonds\n- **Lost:** Thaelen Ruincalen, the last true dragon rider, defected 80 years ago under Caerwyn's command\n\n### Known Position\nLeader of the Wardens of the Realm, one of the Four Pillars.

Or Thaelen?\n\n### The Dragon War\n400 years ago, everything changed:\n- Was Caerwyn High Warden then?\n- Did he fight dragons personally?\n- What role did he play in the breaking of bonds?\n- Does he know the truth about drow involvement?\n\n### Archetype Options\n\n**Option 1 - The Honorable Warrior:** Respects strength, values discipline. Could respect worthy opponents. Might view Thaelen with grudging understanding.\n\n**Option 2 - The Cold Strategist:** Elven lives are resources. Thaelen's defection was asset loss. No sentiment, pure calculation.\n\n**Option 3 - The Haunted Commander:** Carries weight of Dragon War and Thaelen's loss. Duty masks deep wounds. Might secretly long for reconciliation.\n\n**Option 4 - The Zealot:** Believes in elven supremacy through superior force. Thaelen is traitor to be eliminated. No compromise.\n\n### What He Wants\n- The Dragon Knights restored to glory (impossible?)\n- The stain of Thaelen's defection addressed\n- The Empire's military supremacy maintained\n- To understand what went wrong (Thaelen?
