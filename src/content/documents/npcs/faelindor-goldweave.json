  "rawContent": "# Faelindor Goldweave\n\n**Master of Coin** | Granite Tower (Circle of Stewards)\n\n> *\"Gold is not wealth. Gold is possibility. I manage possibilities.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 350 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Male |\n| **Role** | Imperial Treasury Operations |\n| **Reports To** | Second Steward Galadhorn Coinward |\n| **Location** | Granite Tower, Counting Halls |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nFaelindor Goldweave handles the daily operations of the Imperial treasury—payments, receipts, currency exchange, and the mechanics of moving wealth. While Galadhorn tracks the big picture, Faelindor ensures every coin goes where it should. He touches more gold than anyone in the Empire.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nCheerful, efficient, surprisingly humble. Enjoys the puzzle of logistics more than the wealth itself. Takes pride in smooth operations—a delayed payment is a personal failure. Friendly with merchants and clerks; treats everyone's gold as equally important.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Processes thousands of transactions weekly\n- Has personally designed anti-counterfeiting measures\n- Knows every licensed money-changer in the Empire\n- Remarkably uncorrupted despite constant access to wealth\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nHe's noticed small amounts disappearing—not enough to trigger audits, but consistent. Someone is skimming. He suspects a mid-level clerk but has no proof. He's watching, waiting, building a case quietly.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Galadhorn Coinward**: Superior - Reports on daily operations\n- **Faendril**: Professional - Serves the First Steward's office\n- **Guild treasurers**: Regular contact - Handles guild payments\n",
