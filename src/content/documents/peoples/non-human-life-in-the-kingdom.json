  "commonKnowledge": "### The Baseline Restrictions\n\nMost domains enforce **some** version of these rules:\n\n| Restriction | Typical Form | Variation |\n|-------------|--------------|-----------|\n| **Property** | Cannot own land | Some allow leasing; others forbid even that |\n| **Profession** | Limited trades allowed | Varies from \"any unskilled\" to \"none\" |\n| **Marriage** | Cannot marry humans | Universally enforced (both races punished) |\n| **Curfew** | Must be indoors by nightfall | Some enforce strictly; others ignore |\n| **Travel** | Papers required to move between domains | Level of scrutiny varies |\n| **Testimony** | Word of non-human < word of human | In some domains, non-humans cannot testify at all |\n| **Assembly** | Groups of 5+ require permit | Rarely enforced except during \"troubles\" |\n\n### The Eleven Domains: A Breakdown\n\n**Each Lord interprets human supremacy differently:**\n\n---\n\n#### Thornreich (Royal Domain) - **Moderate**\n*King Aldric Greymont*\n\n**Treatment:** Formal restrictions exist but are inconsistently enforced. The capital needs skilled labor.\n\n- Non-humans work in trades (smithing, construction, crafts)\n- Cannot own property but can lease shops\n- Curfew officially exists; guards rarely enforce it\n- The King personally doesn't care about race but can't publicly say so\n\n**Why:** Aldric is a pragmatist. The capital city needs workers. Persecution costs money.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Safest major city. Keep head down, show papers, and you'll be fine.\n\n---\n\n#### Eisenwald - **Harsh**\n*Lord Heinrich von Eisenwald*\n\n**Treatment:** Military domain with rigid hierarchy. Non-humans are tolerated as miners and laborers. Period.\n\n- Limited to manual labor (mines, construction)\n- No skilled trades (seen as taking human jobs)\n- Strict curfew, strictly enforced\n- Barracks-style housing in separate districts\n- \"Work permits\" control who stays\n\n**Why:** Heinrich sees non-humans as tools. Tools don't need rights.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Avoid. If you must pass through, travel during daylight, have paperwork, don't linger.\n\n---\n\n#### Wolfstein - **Brutal**\n*Lord Markus von Wolfstein*\n\n**Treatment:** The border domain is practically a military camp. Non-humans are barely tolerated.\n\n- No non-humans allowed in towns without military escort\n- \"Guest worker\" system: must have human sponsor who's responsible for your behavior\n- Punishments are physical (flogging, branding)\n- Half-elves especially hated (proximity to Thelassian)\n\n**Why:** Markus fights elves on the border. He's transferred that hatred to all non-humans.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Do not enter. Detour through other domains. If caught without papers, expect imprisonment or worse.\n\n---\n\n#### Blackthorne - **Exploitative**\n*Lord Edmund Blackthorne*\n\n**Treatment:** Blackthorne doesn't hate non-humans—he exploits them. Rules are severe but selectively enforced.\n\n- Harsh laws on the books give guards leverage\n- Non-humans can \"buy\" temporary exemptions (bribes)\n- Criminal underclass of non-humans is useful (deniable labor)\n- Informants rewarded; solidarity punished\n\n**Why:** Edmund uses racism as a control mechanism. Fear is cheap. Desperate workers are cheaper.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Dangerous but navigable. Bring money for bribes. Trust no one.\n\n---\n\n#### Ravenscar - **Fair**\n*Lord Godfrey Ravenscar*\n\n**Treatment:** The Queen's brother runs a surprisingly tolerant domain.\n\n- Restrictions exist on paper (politics require it)\n- Enforcement is minimal\n- Non-humans own businesses through \"human partners\" (wink-wink arrangements)\n- No curfew enforcement unless there's actual crime\n- Integrated neighborhoods exist in some towns\n\n**Why:** Godfrey genuinely believes the restrictions are wrong but can't say so publicly. His aunt (the Queen) knows and approves quietly.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** One of the safe domains. The locals will treat you fairly; just don't make waves that force official response.\n\n---\n\n#### Konigsford - **Pragmatic**\n*Lord Wilhelm von Königsford*\n\n**Treatment:** Trade hub where money matters more than race.\n\n- Wealthy non-humans treated well; poor ones treated badly\n- Restrictions relaxed for profitable merchants\n- Formal permits available (expensive) for trading rights\n- Ghettos exist but are more about poverty than race\n\n**Why:** Wilhelm cares about the economy. A dwarf merchant paying taxes is an asset; a dwarf beggar is a problem.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Bring coin and you'll be fine. The domain responds to money, not morality.\n\n---\n\n#### Graustein - **Chaotic**\n*Lord Ludwig von Graustein*\n\n**Treatment:** The succession crisis has left enforcement inconsistent.\n\n- Different towns have different rules\n- Depends on which son's loyalists control the area\n- Some areas strictly enforce; others ignore restrictions entirely\n- Dangerous because unpredictable\n\n**Why:** Ludwig is dying. His three sons are fighting. No one enforces consistent policy.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Research specific routes. The town three miles east might be safe while the next one isn't.\n\n---\n\n#### Belmont - **Hypocritical**\n*Lord Charles de Belmont*\n\n**Treatment:** Official restrictions with constant exceptions for the useful.\n\n- Banking families include non-humans (through fronts)\n- Wealthy non-human merchants protected\n- Poor non-humans face the full weight of law\n- \"Papers can be arranged\" for the right price\n\n**Why:** Charles is bankrupt and needs every source of income. He'll exploit anyone who can pay.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** The domain of purchased tolerance. If you have money, you'll be comfortable. If you don't, avoid it.\n\n---\n\n#### Ashfeld - **Neglectful**\n*Lord Robert Ashfeld*\n\n**Treatment:** Robert is obsessed with Veraheim, not governance. Enforcement is minimal.\n\n- Laws exist; enforcement is rare\n- Remote areas have de facto equality\n- Border communities include mixed families\n- The closer to Veraheim, the more tolerant\n\n**Why:** Robert doesn't care about non-humans one way or another. He cares about conquering Veraheim.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Relatively safe through inattention. The lord has bigger obsessions.\n\n---\n\n#### Thornwood - **Tolerant**\n*Lord Alaric Thornwood*\n\n**Treatment:** The most tolerant domain in the Kingdom.\n\n- Restrictions minimal and rarely enforced\n- Non-humans own property (through creative legal fictions everyone ignores)\n- Integrated communities exist\n- The lord personally helped refugees reach Veraheim (secretly)\n\n**Why:** Alaric believes the restrictions are immoral. He won't lead a revolt but won't enforce evil laws either.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** The safest domain. Alaric's territory is where the underground railroad passes through.\n\n---\n\n#### Valcourt - **Civilized Prejudice**\n*Lord Bertrand de Valcourt*\n\n**Treatment:** Polite, cultured discrimination.\n\n- Non-humans treated like servants—respected servants, but servants\n- \"Proper behavior\" expected at all times\n- Elite non-humans accepted in restricted spaces\n- The prejudice is real but comes with manners\n\n**Why:** Bertrand is sophisticated. He'd never use a slur—but he genuinely believes humans are superior.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Know your place and you'll be treated decently. Push for equality and discover the steel beneath the silk.\n\n---\n\n#### Rotfels - **Maritime Pragmatism**\n*Lord Konrad von Rotfels*\n\n**Treatment:** Ships don't care about race. On land, it's different.\n\n- At sea: Skill matters, not race. Mixed crews common.\n- In port: Standard restrictions enforced\n- The fleet is an escape valve for ambitious non-humans\n- Marines can rise to authority (unofficially)\n\n**Why:** Konrad needs sailors. Dead sailors don't help. Skilled non-human sailors do.\n\n**For non-human PCs:** Join the fleet or avoid the ports. The contradiction is deliberate.\n\n---",
