  "rawContent": "# Caladir Inkwell\n\n**Second Remembrancer** | Silvered Tower (Council of Memory)\n\n> *\"Every word ever written still exists. I know where.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 520 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Male |\n| **Role** | Head Archivist, Thaelorin's Deputy |\n| **Reports To** | First Remembrancer Thaelorin |\n| **Location** | Silvered Tower, Archive Levels |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nCaladir Inkwell manages the physical archives of the Thelassian—millions of documents across 1,500 years of history. He can locate any record within hours, often minutes. While Thaelorin is the living memory of the Empire, Caladir is the keeper of its written one.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nObsessively organized, deeply satisfied by cataloguing. Speaks quickly, often distracted by thoughts of documents that need attention. Surprisingly friendly for someone who spends centuries surrounded by paper. Treats the archives as sacred spaces—damaging a document is unforgivable.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Has personally read approximately 2% of the archives (still more than anyone else)\n- Created the current filing system 300 years ago (still improving it)\n- Can retrieve most requested documents from memory of location\n- Considers \"lost\" documents a personal insult\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nHe knows there are sealed sections even he cannot access. Thaelorin has the only keys. Caladir has spent 200 years trying to deduce what's hidden there from gaps in other records. He's made disturbing progress.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Thaelorin**: Superior - Deep respect, occasional frustration at secrets kept\n- **Thaelindra Quillsong**: Colleague - Imperial Chronicler, frequent collaboration\n- **Nalindra Quietvoice**: Professional - Provides records for investigations\n",
