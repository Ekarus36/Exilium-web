  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nDark auburn hair, worn long and impeccably styled even at sea. Green eyes, always glinting with amusement. Lean, athletic, moves like a dancer. Flamboyant embroidered coats, polished boots, a rapier at his hip that's more than decorative. He looks like he stepped out of a romance novel. Infuriatingly, he fights like it too.\n\n### Personality\nNever met a room he couldn't dominate. Boasts constantly about his victories. Compares himself favorably to legends. Absolutely insufferable at parties. But every boast has a story behind it, and every story is true. He really did sink three Kingdom warships alone. He really is that good.\n\n### The Ship: *The Last Dance*\nSleek, fast, maneuverable. Built for speed and agility, not cargo. Custom modifications for rapid course changes. Light armament but perfectly placed. The most responsive ship in the Isles. Every engagement with The Rapier is your last dance.\n\n### Combat Legend\n- **Undefeated in 1v1** - no captain has beaten him alone\n- **Deadly in 2v1** - regularly defeats two ships\n- **Has won 3v1** - twice, under exceptional circumstances\n- Tactical genius, ship mastery, elite crew, unconventional maneuvers\n\n### Known Relationships\n- **The Storm:** One of few captains he's acknowledged. Got a nod once. Won't shut up about it.\n- **The Admiral:** Mutual contempt. They argue at every Moot.\n- **Queen Graza:** Loyal to the Isles, not personally to her. Attends Moot when he feels like it.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nBeneath the swagger is genuine talent AND genuine insecurity. The performance never stops because stopping would mean facing who he is without the legend. He's 42—not old, but not young. How long can he stay undefeated? The question haunts him in quiet moments.\n\n### Why One Ship\n- More ships means more responsibility\n- Can't personally command multiple vessels\n- Doesn't want to be an admiral—wants to be a legend\n- The solo act IS the identity\n\n### The Crew of *The Last Dance*\n~80 sailors, each hand-picked. Best paid crew in the Isles per person. Fanatically loyal. He tests potential sailors personally, looking for skill AND personality. Many apply, few are chosen. Losing them would devastate him more than losing the ship.\n\n### His Code\n- Takes cargo and valuables\n- Releases crews with their lives\n- Sometimes returns personal effects (theatrical generosity)\n- Always leaves survivors to spread stories\n- *\"Dead men tell no tales. I need tales told.\"*\n- Won't do slaving (distasteful, not sporting)\n- Won't attack helpless targets (no glory)\n\n### The Storm Acknowledgment\nThat nod from Vaelith is his most treasured possession. He brings it up constantly because it's the only external validation that matters to him. The Storm acknowledged him. That makes him real.\n\n### What He Wants\n- To stay the legend\n- To die dramatically, not quietly\n- The story to never end\n- Someone worthy to pass *The Last Dance* to (hasn't found them)\n\n### What He Fears\n- Growing old and slow\n- Being forgotten\n- A defeat that ends the legend\n- The day someone better comes along\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Challenge** | Someone claims they can beat The Rapier 1v1. He's obligated to respond. Is it a trap? |\n| **The Heir** | A noble family wants their child retrieved from his crew. They joined willingly. |\n| **The Rematch** | The Empire admiral he humiliated has a new ship and a plan. |\n| **The Protégé** | Rennick offers to train a promising young captain. Teaching methods are intense. |\n| **The Impossible Bet** | He wagered he could do something even he might not pull off. |\n\n---",
