  "atAGlance": "The Aloria isn't really a kingdom—it's eleven nearly autonomous domains held together by gold, fear, and one man's diplomatic genius.\n\nKing Aldric controls the richest gold mines. He uses them to fund a standing army of 10,000 soldiers loyal only to the crown. The eleven Lords scheme constantly against each other (and sometimes against him), but they need his gold and his army to protect them from the Thelassian.\n\nThey believe in human supremacy as fiercely as elves believe in theirs. Non-humans are second-class at best. The Kingdom lost Vera Wyrdweaver—their most powerful sorceress—80 years ago, and some Lords have never stopped dreaming of conquering Veraheim to prove they didn't need her anyway.\n\n*Common saying: \"In the Kingdom, your sword arm matters more than your bloodline. But gold matters most of all.\"*\n\n---",
  "commonKnowledge": "### The King's Balancing Act\n\n**King Aldric Greymont** maintains power through:\n- **Gold mines**: Buys loyalty when diplomacy fails\n- **Royal tax**: 20% of Lords' revenue funds the standing army\n- **Standing army**: 10,000 soldiers loyal to crown, not Lords\n- **Careful balance**: Never let one Lord get too powerful\n- **Playing Lords against each other**: Prevent unified opposition\n\n**The Heir Problem**: [Prince Roderick Greymont](/npcs/prince-roderick-greymont) is martial, aggressive, and impatient. He wants to conquer Veraheim. His father knows that would be suicide. They clash constantly.\n\n### Succession\n\n**The rules are simple. Enforcing them is not.**\n\n**Order of succession:**\n1. The King's heir (if of age)\n2. Queen as Regent (if heir is underage)\n3. King's brother or nearest blood relative\n4. A Lord appointed as Regent (theoretical—has never survived in practice)\n\n**There is no legal way to challenge succession.** No petition, no council vote, no declaration of unfitness. If you believe the heir shouldn't rule, you say it with your army, not your words. The throne belongs to whoever the Royal Army supports.\n\n**Why this matters now:**\n- Roderick is 28—no regency needed when Aldric dies\n- Margarethe becomes Dowager Queen with no formal authority\n- Her influence depends entirely on her son listening to her\n- He won't. Eisenwald and Blackthorne already have his ear.\n\n**The unspoken truth:** When Aldric dies, Margarethe's spy network becomes her only power. If Roderick leads the Kingdom into war or ruin, her choices are: watch it happen, or find Lords willing to stop him by force.\n\n*Common saying: \"The crown passes by blood. It stays by steel.\"*\n\n### The Eleven Lords\n\nEach Lord rules nearly autonomously within their domain. They collect taxes, maintain armies, enforce laws—and scheme for more power.\n\n| Lord | Domain | Alignment | Key Trait |\n|------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| [Lord Edmund Blackthorne](/npcs/lord-edmund-blackthorne) | Blackthorne | ⚠️ Dangerous | Ruthless schemer |\n| [Lord Robert Ashfeld](/npcs/lord-robert-ashfeld) | Ashfeld | Ambitious | Veraheim-obsessed |\n| [Lord Heinrich von Eisenwald](/npcs/lord-heinrich-von-eisenwald) | Eisenwald | Militant | War hawk, Prince's ear |\n| [Lord Wilhelm von Königsford](/npcs/lord-wilhelm-von-knigsford) | Königsford | Loyal | King's closest ally |\n| [Lord Godfrey Ravenscar](/npcs/lord-godfrey-ravenscar) | Ravenscar | Loyal | Queen's brother |\n| [Lord Alaric Thornwood](/npcs/lord-alaric-thornwood) | Thornwood | Neutral | Border guardian |\n| [Lord Bertrand de Valcourt](/npcs/lord-bertrand-de-valcourt) | Valcourt | Cultured | Diplomat, elven contact |\n| [Lord Charles de Belmont](/npcs/lord-charles-de-belmont) | Belmont | Wealthy | Banker, debt schemes |\n| [Lord Konrad von Rotfels](/npcs/lord-konrad-von-rotfels) | Rotfels | Militant | Mountain fortress |\n| [Lord Ludwig von Graustein](/npcs/lord-ludwig-von-graustein) | Graustein | Uncertain | Succession crisis |\n| [Lord Markus von Wolfstein](/npcs/lord-markus-von-wolfstein) | Wolfstein | Aggressive | Border raider |\n\n### Human Supremacy\n\nLike elves, humans believe in their own superiority:\n- Non-humans are second-class citizens\n- Half-breeds treated with suspicion\n- No execution policy for drow (unlike elves), but hatred runs deep\n- Vera's defection seen as betrayal of \"her people\"\n\n### Military\n\n**The Lords' Forces** (~15,000-20,000 combined):\n- Each Lord maintains own army\n- Quality varies wildly\n- Loyal to their Lord, not the King\n\n**The Royal Army** (10,000):\n- Professional soldiers, well-trained\n- Loyal only to the crown\n- Funded by royal tax\n- The King's true power\n\n**Compared to Elves**: Humans have numbers; elves have quality. Neither can conquer the other.\n\n### The Veraheim Obsession\n\nMultiple Lords dream of conquering Veraheim:\n- **Ashfeld**: Has detailed invasion plans\n- **Eisenwald**: Believes military glory awaits\n- **Roderick**: Wants to prove himself as warrior-king\n\nWhy they can't: Dragon. Vera's power. Economic suicide. The King forbids it.\n\nWhy they keep dreaming: Whoever controls the tunnel controls east-west trade. That Lord could challenge the throne.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Queen's Web\n\n[Queen Margarethe Greymont](/npcs/queen-margarethe-greymont) runs the Kingdom's intelligence network. Her ladies-in-waiting are spies. Her charity visits are interrogations. She knows more about the Lords' schemes than her husband does.\n\n**What she's discovered:**\n- Blackthorne murdered his brother for the title (no proof)\n- Belmont is bankrupt, hiding it with creative accounting\n- Three Lords have secret dealings with Broken Isles pirates\n- Her son Roderick has been manipulated by Eisenwald\n\n**What she does with it**: Feeds information to Aldric selectively. Protects her son from his own stupidity. Waits, watches, and prepares.\n\n### Lord Blackthorne's Long Game\n\nEdmund Blackthorne isn't just scheming for more power—he wants the throne. He's been working toward it for twenty years.\n\n**His plan:**\n1. Weaken rival Lords through manipulation ✓\n2. Gain Prince Roderick's trust ✓\n3. Isolate the King (in progress)\n4. When Aldric dies, be positioned as Roderick's chief advisor\n5. Control the new King, then... accidents happen\n\n**What he doesn't know**: The Queen suspects him. She's documenting everything.\n\n### The Pirate Connections\n\nThree Lords secretly deal with Broken Isles pirates:\n- **Blackthorne**: Funds specific captains to raid rivals' shipping\n- **Belmont**: Buys stolen goods at discount, sells as \"salvage\"\n- **Ashfeld**: Trades shipping information for cuts of pirate profit\n\n[Delara Silvertongue](/npcs/delara-silvertongue) in Saltmere has documentation on all three. She hasn't used it—yet.\n\n### The Succession Crisis\n\nWhen Aldric dies, the Kingdom will fracture unless:\n- Roderick proves himself quickly\n- The Queen maintains her network\n- No Lord makes a move before Roderick consolidates\n\n**The nightmare scenario**: Aldric dies before Roderick matures. Multiple Lords declare independence or make plays for the throne.

He hasn't decided yet.\n\n**Who knows**: The Queen suspects. Velindor Shadowmere (Empire spymaster) knows for certain and finds it useful.\n\n### The Vera Wound\n\nThe Kingdom's greatest sorceress defected 80 years ago. Some Lords were children then; others weren't born. But the wound festers.\n\n**The official story**: Vera was seduced by an elf, betrayed her people.\n\n**The truth Aldric knows**: Vera left because the Kingdom tried to force her to use her power for war. She refused. They threatened her. She demonstrated what threatening her meant. Then she left with the elf who warned her.\n\n**Why it matters**: Vera could have been an asset. The Kingdom's arrogance drove her away.
