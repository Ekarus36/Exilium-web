The sprawling goblin city operates less like a settlement and more like a massive corporate workshop—thousands of goblins organized into chaotic-but-functional hierarchy, all dedicated to one purpose: ships.\n\nThe Skarath Shipwright Collective runs everything. Every goblin is technically an employee. The city exists to build ships. Everything else is secondary.\n\n*Common saying: \"Goblins alone: weak. Goblins together: still weak.

  "commonKnowledge": "### Geography\n\nBuilt along a natural deep-water bay. Multiple dry docks carved into the shoreline. Workshops climbing up the hillside in terraces. Constant sound of hammering, sawing, shouting. Ships in various stages of construction everywhere.\n\n**Key Areas:**\n- **The Yards**: Main shipbuilding area, dozens of dry docks\n- **The Stacks**: Residential/workshop terraces climbing the hill\n- **Timber Bay**: Raw lumber storage and treatment\n- **The Brass Market**: Commercial district, parts trading\n- **The Dry Bones**: Ship breaking yard (salvage operations)\n\n### The Collective\n\nThe Shipwright Collective is a corporation that runs the city:\n\n**Grand Tinkerboss** (CEO/Mayor): Rizkit Brassclaw, elected by the Brassmoot, serves until death or \"vote of no confidence\" (usually fatal).\n\n**The Brassmoot** (Board): Council of Overbosses who vote on major decisions.\n\n**Overbosses** (Division Heads): Control Hulls, Rigging, Fittings, Repairs, Parts, Breaking, Timber, and Counting (finance).\n\n**Corporate Values** (posted everywhere):\n1. Ship comes first\n2. Measure twice, cut once\n3. The customer pays (always)\n4. Family gets discount (but family still pays)\n5. Don't blow up the workshop (again)\n\n### The Ironhold Partnership\n\nSkarath needs metal; Ironhold needs timber. Essential symbiosis.\n\nTrade caravans run constantly between the cities. Skarath sends lumber, receives anchors, chains, fittings, nails. Neither city would survive without the other. Both know it. Negotiations are tense but always successful.\n\n### What They Build\n\n**Standard Offerings:**\n- Sloops (small, fast) - 2-4 weeks\n- Brigantines (medium, versatile) - 6-8 weeks\n- Galleons (large, cargo/war) - 3-4 months\n\n**Custom Work:**\n- Hidden compartments (smuggling)\n- Reinforced hulls (ramming)\n- Speed modifications\n- Anything you can pay for\n\n**Repair Services:**\n- Emergency patching (same day)\n- Full overhauls (weeks)\n- Battle damage (specialty)\n\n### Quality Guarantee\n\nEvery ship gets the Skarath Seal—a brass plate with the shipwright's mark. If a ship fails due to construction defect within one year, the Collective pays for repairs. This guarantee is sacred. Violating it would destroy their reputation.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### Rizkit's Problem\n\nGrand Tinkerboss Rizkit Brassclaw is 67 years old—ancient for a goblin. He has no clear successor, and three Overbosses are positioning to replace him:\n\n**Overboss Gizka** (Hulls): Competent, conservative, boring. Would maintain status quo.\n\n**Overboss Snaggle** (Repairs): Ambitious, innovative, reckless. Would expand aggressively.\n\n**Overboss Krix** (Counting): Cunning, patient, ruthless. Would squeeze every copper from every contract.\n\nWhen Rizkit dies (soon, probably), the Brassmoot will deadlock. Factional fighting could cripple production. [Ironhold](/geography/ironhold) is watching nervously—they need Skarath functional.\n\n### The Timber War\n\nGreenfire Isle's forests are being depleted. At current harvest rates, Skarath will run out of quality shipbuilding timber in 20-30 years.\n\n**Options being secretly discussed:**\n- Expand logging to other islands (political problems)\n- Import timber from mainland (expensive, dangerous)\n- Develop alternative materials (experimental)\n- Seize control of [Mistwood](/geography/mistwood)'s forests (war)\n\nRizkit knows but hasn't told the Brassmoot. He's hoping to die before it becomes his problem.\n\n### The Secret Drydock\n\nDeep in a hidden cove, Skarath maintains a secret facility for \"special projects\":\n- Ships with no registration\n- Experimental designs\n- Vessels for clients who can't be seen dealing with pirates\n\nThe Empire has commissioned three ships here over the past decade. Officially, the Empire has no contact with the Broken Isles. Rizkit keeps very good records.\n\n### Quality Control Corruption\n\nOverboss Krix (Counting) has been accepting bribes to approve substandard work. Three ships in the past year received the Skarath Seal despite known defects.\n\nIf one fails catastrophically, the scandal would destroy the Collective's reputation. Rizkit suspects but can't prove it. Krix is covering tracks carefully.\n\n### The Storm's Ship\n\n[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor)'s dreadnought *Sorrow* was built in Skarath 180 years ago. The original shipwright's notes still exist in the Collective archives—including design weaknesses.\n\n**Who knows:**\n- The current archivist (old goblin named Scribs)\n- Rizkit (who's never told anyone)\n- The Storm himself (probably)\n\nIf those notes reached the wrong hands, *Sorrow* could be vulnerable. Scribs has been offered enormous bribes. He's refused so far. He's also very old.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Succession Crisis** | Rizkit is dying. The Overbosses are positioning. Someone wants the PCs to influence the outcome. |\n| **The Defective Ship** | A Skarath-built vessel sank, killing dozens. Was it Krix's corruption or sabotage? |\n| **The Secret Drydock** | Someone's building a ship in the hidden facility. For whom? To do what? |\n| **The Archivist's Choice** | Old Scribs has the *Sorrow*'s weaknesses. He's been offered enough gold to buy an island. What does he do? |\n| **The Timber Crisis** | A faction wants to seize Mistwood's forests. Prevent war or profit from it? |\n| **The Empire's Ships** | Proof of the secret Imperial commissions could embarrass powerful elves. Worth something to the right buyer. |\n\n### Relationship with Ironhold\n\nThe partnership is essential but not friendly. Hobgoblins look down on goblins. Goblins resent the condescension.\n\n**Forge Marshal Kethrak's view:** Skarath is a necessary supplier, nothing more. Goblins are useful but inferior.\n\n**Grand Tinkerboss Rizkit's view:** Hobgoblins are arrogant customers who'd be nothing without goblin ships. But their money spends fine.\n\nIf the partnership ever broke, both cities would suffer. Neither wants that. But neither likes the other.\n\n---",
