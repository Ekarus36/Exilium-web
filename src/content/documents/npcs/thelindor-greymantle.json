  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nThelindor Greymantle did not ask for this job. He was appointed 150 years ago because he was efficient, neutral, and had no strong opinions on non-elves. He accepted because refusing would have ended his career.\n\n150 years later, he has opinions.\n\nEvery day, he sees talented dwarven craftsmen denied permits because an elf wanted their workshop space. He processes execution orders for humans whose only crime was being human in the wrong place. He registers half-elven children who will never be accepted by either parent's people.\n\nHe still does his job. What choice does he have? The system exists with or without him. At least he can be fair within its rules.\n\nBut he's been quietly bending those rules for decades.\n\n### The Small Mercies\nThings Thelindor has done without authorization:\n- \"Lost\" paperwork for refugees fleeing worse persecution\n- Extended work permits that should have expired\n- Assigned non-elves to lenient judges when possible\n- Warned communities before \"random\" inspections\n- Quietly helped families reach Veraheim\n\nNone of this is treason. All of it is career-ending if discovered. He tells himself he's just being efficient—eliminating unnecessary suffering. But he knows the truth.\n\n### His Private Files\nHe keeps unauthorized records:\n- Economic contributions by non-elven workers (proving their value)\n- Cases where non-elves were punished more harshly than elves for identical crimes\n- Evidence that the Empire depends on non-elven labor\n- A list of every execution he's been unable to prevent\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do with these files. Maybe nothing. Maybe everything.\n\n### What He Sees Daily\nThe contradiction at the heart of elven supremacy:\n- The Empire needs non-elven labor (elves won't do certain work)\n- Non-elven craftsmen produce essential goods\n- Trade depends on non-elven merchants as intermediaries\n- The system that oppresses them requires their participation\n\nHe sees this. Faendril sees this. Neither can say it aloud.\n\n### His Relationship with Faendril\nFaendril appointed him and depends on him.
