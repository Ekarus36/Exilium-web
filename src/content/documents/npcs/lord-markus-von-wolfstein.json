  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nWeathered, scarred, clearly a warrior. Grey-streaked dark hair worn wild. Fierce grey eyes. Missing two fingers on left hand (elven blade). Dresses practically in furs and leather. Looks like he could kill you—and he could. Speaks bluntly, often rudely.\n\n### Personality\nDirect, no patience for games. Hates elves with genuine passion. Respects strength, despises weakness. Loyal to those who earn it. Independent, resents outside authority. Would rather fight than talk. Doesn't understand why everyone isn't focused on the real enemy.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Greta (née Thornwood, 40) - Lord Thornwood's sister. Tough mountain wife, adapted to frontier life.\n- **Heir:** Viktor (22) - Already a veteran, eager for more fighting. Possibly reckless.\n- **Second Son:** Erik (19) - Scout, studies elves rather than just hating them. Father finds this uncomfortable.\n- **Daughter:** Brunhilde (35) - From first wife (deceased). Married to Lord Heinrich von Eisenwald.\n- **Daughter:** Helga (16) - Learning to fight, already hates elves.\n\n### Domain & Military\nRules ~8,000 hardy mountain folk. Commands 2,000 veteran soldiers—actual combat experience against elves. Best light infantry in the Kingdom. The border is his domain's entire purpose.\n\n### Political Position\nPart of the Military Bloc with Eisenwald (through Brunhilde's marriage) and loosely Thornwood. Frustrated by lack of Kingdom support. Attends court minimally. Wants a real campaign against the elves, not endless skirmishing.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nMarkus is exactly what he appears—a frontier warrior who defines himself by fighting elves. He's not subtle or complex. His hatred is genuine, born from 30 years of losing friends and family. He can't understand why the Kingdom prioritizes politics over the real threat.\n\n### The Border Reality\nThe \"border skirmishes\" are more serious than most realize:\n- There IS a standing truce with the Thelassian\n- Both sides violate it constantly\n- Markus has launched unauthorized raids\n- The elves have responded in kind\n- Full extent could accuse Markus of provoking war\n\nIf the Kingdom learned everything, Markus could be blamed for the ongoing conflict.\n\n### Erik's Secret Understanding\nThe second son has done something his father would hate:\n- Talked to elven prisoners\n- Understands they're soldiers, not monsters\n- Keeps this knowledge secret\n- Might be the key to actual peace someday\n- Father would be appalled\n\n### The Mercenary Contracts\nWolfstein-trained fighters are highly valued:\n- Some serve as far as Veraheim\n- Some have fought FOR the Broken Isles pirates\n- Gold is gold in the mountains\n- The King doesn't know the full extent\n\n### First Wife's Death\nMarkus's first wife died in an elven raid 20 years ago. Brunhilde was young. This is the root of his hatred—not ideology, but grief. He's never processed it. He never will.\n\n### What He Wants\n- Kingdom support for a real campaign\n- Recognition for Wolfstein sacrifices\n- To push the border back\n- Revenge for everyone he's lost\n\n### What He Fears\n- The border breaking (elven invasion)\n- His children fighting his war forever\n- The Kingdom abandoning the frontier\n- Dying without seeing the elves defeated\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Border Incident** | An elven noble dies in Wolfstein territory. Accident, provocation, or setup? War threatens. |\n| **The Prisoner** | Erik captures an elf who knows something important. What does he do with the information? |\n| **The Alliance** | Heinrich von Eisenwald proposes a joint offensive. Brilliant strategy or suicide? |\n| **Viktor's Rage** | The heir pursues elves into their territory. Rescue mission or consequences? |\n| **The Truth** | Evidence of Markus's unauthorized raids surfaces. Cover-up or confession? |\n\n---",
