  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nSeraphel Dawnblade is a woman holding together something that should have died 400 years ago through sheer will. She knows the Dragon Knights are an anachronism—warriors trained for a partnership that will never return. But she cannot let go. The order is all she has, all she is, all she believes in.\n\nShe's not delusional. She knows dragons probably won't return. But \"probably\" isn't \"certainly,\" and someone has to keep the flame alive. If she stops believing, if she lets the order fade into just another military unit, then the 47 who died and the traditions they protected meant nothing.\n\n### The Thaelen Wound\nHe was her mentor. For 50 years, she learned everything from him—sword, tactics, honor, what it meant to be a Dragon Knight. She idolized him. When he defected, it broke something in her.\n\n**What She Feels:**\n- Betrayal (he abandoned everything they stood for)\n- Confusion (how could he choose a human over the order?)\n- Secret understanding (she saw how he looked at the sky, looking for something missing)\n- Anger at herself (should she have seen it coming?)\n\n**What She Did:**\nShe's the one who turned his armor to face the wall. She did it herself, alone, at midnight. She cried while doing it—the only time she's cried in 200 years.\n\n**What She Wants:**\nTo understand. Not to forgive—understanding first. Why wasn't the order enough? Why wasn't she enough? Was everything he taught her a lie, or did he believe it once?\n\n### The Secret Hope\nIn her private quarters, she keeps a dragon scale. Not from Thorongil—from a wild dragon, found in the mountains 100 years ago. It means dragons still exist. It means bonds might still be possible.\n\nShe's never told anyone. If people knew she held hope, they might think the order's purpose is faith, not training. The knights must be warriors first, dreamers second.\n\n### Her Private Ritual\nEvery year, on the anniversary of the Dragon War's end, she climbs to the Iron Tower's Eyrie alone. She stands on the dragon perches—built for creatures that haven't landed there in 400 years—and waits until dawn. She's done this for 200 years. No dragon has ever come.\n\nShe'll do it until she dies.\n\n### What She Wants\n- Dragons to return (even knowing they probably won't)\n- The order to matter again\n- To understand Thaelen's choice\n- Perhaps: to see Thorongil once, to know what a bond looks like\n\n### What She Fears\n- The order becoming meaningless (just soldiers with a fancy name)\n- Learning Thaelen was right to leave\n- Dying without ever seeing a dragon bond\n- Being remembered as the commander who presided over the order's slow death\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Letter** | Thaelen sends a message after 80 years of silence. It's addressed to her. What does it say? |\n| **Dragon Sighting** | Reports of a dragon in the mountains. Real or rumor? She has to know. |\n| **The Scale** | Someone discovers her secret hope. Does it inspire or undermine the order? |\n| **Knight's Honor** | A Dragon Knight commits a crime. She must judge—by old laws or new realities? |\n| **The Last Ride** | She's dying.
