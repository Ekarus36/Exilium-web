  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nAverage height, tries to look taller. Brown hair going grey early from stress. Eager, almost desperate expression. Dresses too expensively—overcompensating. Constantly fidgeting, restless energy. Tries too hard to seem noble, which makes him seem less so.\n\n### Personality\nBurning desire to be taken seriously. Feels every slight, real or imagined. Generous to those who show respect, vindictive to those who mock him. Would risk everything for glory. Not stupid, but desperation clouds his judgment.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Helena (née Thornwood, 38) - Lord Thornwood's sister. Loves Robert, wishes he'd stop chasing impossible dreams.\n- **Heir:** Thomas (17) - Practical, skeptical. Questions father's obsession. Growing rift between them.\n- **Second Son:** William (15) - Believes everything father says. Wants to be the conqueror. Dangerous enthusiasm.\n- **Sister:** Seraphina (28) - Married to Lord Blackthorne. Robert doesn't know how bad things are.\n- **Daughter:** Margaret (13) - Quiet, observant, may be the smartest Ashfeld.\n\n### Domain & Position\nRules ~12,000 people on the eastern frontier. Actually prosperous—volcanic soil is fertile, and tunnel trade brings money. Commands 1,500 soldiers (eager but untested). His proximity to Veraheim is both his obsession and his actual value.\n\n### The Veraheim Obsession\nRobert's constant topic. He proposes attacks at every council. Other Lords mock him: \"If it's so easy, why haven't YOU done it?\" He has maps, plans, theories—all fantasy. Thorongil would destroy any assault. But Robert can't stop.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nRobert isn't evil—he's desperate. His family was elevated from merchants only three generations ago. Old nobility still calls them \"upstarts\" behind their backs. Robert has spent his entire life trying to earn respect he'll never receive. Veraheim is his answer: conquer the unconquerable, and no one can question his worth.\n\n### The Real Problem\nRobert's obsession has cost him:\n- **His son's respect:** Thomas thinks his father is a fool\n- **His sister's safety:** He married Seraphina to Blackthorne for the alliance\n- **His wealth:** Borrowed 8,000 gold from Belmont for military buildup\n- **His judgment:** Every decision filters through \"will this help me take Veraheim?\"\n\n### Seraphina's Situation\nRobert's sister is being abused by Edmund Blackthorne. Signs exist:\n- She's withdrawn, frightened in public appearances\n- Her letters are brief and formal\n- Helena (Robert's wife) suspects something is wrong\n\nRobert doesn't want to see it. Acknowledging it means admitting the Blackthorne alliance was a mistake. So he doesn't look closely.\n\n### The Debts\nOwes Belmont 8,000 gold, borrowed for:\n- Military expansion\n- Better equipment\n- Fortification improvements\n\nFinancial ruin is one bad year away. If Belmont calls the loan, Ashfeld collapses.\n\n### The Tunnel Maps\nRobert has been secretly surveying approaches to Veraheim:\n- Detailed maps of terrain\n- Guard rotation observations\n- Tunnel entrance analysis\n\nThis information is actually valuable—to someone planning something more subtle than assault.\n\n### Thomas's Secret Plan\nThe heir is quietly preparing for inheritance:\n- Building relationships with other heirs\n- Learning actual domain management\n- Planning to abandon Veraheim obsession immediately\n- Father doesn't know—it would break his heart\n\n### What He Wants\n- Respect from the old families\n- To conquer Veraheim (ultimate validation)\n- His name remembered forever\n- To stop feeling like a fraud\n\n### What He Fears\n- Being dismissed as \"the merchant Lord\"\n- His family falling back to common status\n- Never achieving glory\n- Dying having accomplished nothing\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Desperate Plan** | Robert finally found allies for his Veraheim attack. It will fail catastrophically unless stopped. |\n| **The Sister's Fate** | Evidence of Seraphina's abuse reaches Robert. Does he act, or protect his alliance? |\n| **The Maps** | Robert's tunnel surveys are valuable. Someone wants them—for what purpose? |\n| **Debt Comes Due** | Belmont calls the loans. Robert faces ruin unless he does something desperate. |\n| **William's Glory** | The younger son decides to prove himself. His \"heroic\" action could doom the family. |\n\n---",
