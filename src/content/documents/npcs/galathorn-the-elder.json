  "rawContent": "# Galathorn the Elder\n\n**High Arbiter** | Silvered Tower (Council of Memory)\n\n> *\"I have judged ten thousand cases. The law does not change. Only those who face it.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 750 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Male |\n| **Role** | Senior Judge |\n| **Reports To** | First Remembrancer Thaelorin |\n| **Location** | Silvered Tower, Hall of Echoes |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nGalathorn the Elder is the most senior judge in the Empire, second only to Thaelorin in legal authority. He has presided over the most significant cases of the past 500 years. His rulings are studied by law students; his interpretations become precedent. He is the law made flesh.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nAncient, implacable, absolutely consistent. Shows no emotion during proceedings. Rules based on evidence and precedent, never sympathy. Some call him heartless; he considers consistency a form of compassion. Everyone knows exactly what to expect from him.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Has served as judge for 500+ years\n- His rulings have never been overturned by Thaelorin\n- Presided over several noble house disgrace cases\n- Training his eventual replacement (a process taking decades)\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nHe sentenced an innocent elf to exile 200 years ago. He realized his error a decade later. The elf died before he could correct it. He's never told anyone. He still applies the law perfectly—but he no longer believes it's perfect.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Thaelorin**: Superior - Only authority that can overturn him\n- **Nalindra Quietvoice**: Professional - She prosecutes, he judges\n- **Lady Ithilwen Thelindor**: Former student - Trained her in legal reasoning\n",
