  "rawContent": "# fsevents\n\nNative access to MacOS FSEvents in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)\n\nThe FSEvents API in MacOS allows applications to register for notifications of\nchanges to a given directory tree. It is a very fast and lightweight alternative\nto kqueue.\n\nThis is a low-level library. For a cross-platform file watching module that\nuses fsevents, check out [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\nnpm install fsevents\n```\n\nSupports only **Node.js v8.16 and higher**.\n\n```js\nconst fsevents = require('fsevents');\n\n// To start observation\nconst stop = fsevents.watch(__dirname, (path, flags, id) => {\n  const info = fsevents.getInfo(path, flags);\n});\n\n// To end observation\nstop();\n```\n\n> **Important note:** The API behaviour is slightly different from typical JS APIs. The `stop` function **must** be\n> retrieved and stored somewhere, even if you don't plan to stop the watcher. If you forget it, the garbage collector\n> will eventually kick in, the watcher will be unregistered, and your callbacks won't be called anymore.\n\nThe callback passed as the second parameter to `.watch` get's called whenever the operating system detects a\na change in the file system.
