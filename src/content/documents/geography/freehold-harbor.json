  "commonKnowledge": "### Geography\n\nThe harbor is a geological marvel—an ancient volcanic crater that collapsed and flooded.\n\n**The Throat**: Single narrow entrance where only one ship can pass at a time. Shore batteries on both cliffs. Any attacking fleet would die ship by ship. This geography makes Freehold nearly impregnable.\n\n**Inside**: Deep water accommodating hundreds of ships. Volcanic cliffs surround the harbor. Protected from storms. Natural hot springs from volcanic activity.\n\n### Districts\n\n**The Docks**: Working waterfront, hundreds of berths, constant loading and unloading, ship chandlers and supplies.\n\n**The Market**: Where loot becomes gold. Fencing operations, \"no questions asked\" trading, exotic goods from across the seas.\n\n**The Tavern Quarter**: Dozens of taverns, gambling halls, brothels. Where crews spend their shares. Social heart of Freehold.\n\n**The Monarch's Keep**: Graza Bloodtide's residence, where The Moot convenes, dispute resolution, treasury.\n\n**Shipwright's Row**: Ship repairs, sailmakers, ropemakers. Goblin craftsmen dominate.\n\n### Harbor Peace\n\nThe sacred law within Freehold:\n- **No violence** against other pirates\n- **No theft** from other pirates  \n- **No attacks** on ships coming or going\n- **Violation = Death** from ALL captains collectively\n\nWhy it works: Everyone benefits from safe harbor. Merchants won't come without it. Self-interest enforces the rule better than any law.\n\n### The Moot\n\nQuarterly assembly of all captains and settlement leaders:\n- Old business resolved\n- New disputes heard\n- Major decisions voted\n- Announcements and warnings\n\nMissing too many sessions means losing influence.\n\n### Notable Locations\n\n**The Rusty Anchor**: Largest tavern, neutral ground for negotiations, three floors, always crowded.\n\n**The Black Market**: Not actually hidden. Open-air market for fenced goods. Mainland merchants shop here.\n\n**The Pit**: Fighting arena for disputes and entertainment (non-lethal). Heavy betting.\n\n**The Tide's Memory**: Shrine to lost sailors. Multi-faith. Surprisingly respected.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Real Power Structure\n\nGraza Bloodtide sits on the throne, but she doesn't truly rule.\n\n**[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) (The Storm)** is the real power. His dreadnought *Sorrow* has a reserved berth that no one else dares use. When he appears, arguments end. When he speaks, everyone listens. When he leaves, Graza can play at being Monarch again.\n\nGraza knows this. She hates it. She's building alliances, trying to find leverage against The Storm. If she can't become his equal, she'll never truly rule.\n\n### Mainland Connections\n\n**Secret traders**: Several Kingdom merchants maintain secret contacts in Freehold. They buy stolen goods at deep discount, sell them as \"salvage.\" Two lords secretly fund specific pirate captains to raid their rivals' shipping.\n\n**Imperial spies**: The Thelassian has agents in Freehold. They monitor shipping, track cargo, identify which pirates are most dangerous. They've considered assassination but fear what unified pirate response would look like.\n\n### The Volcanic Secret\n\nBeneath Freehold, the volcano isn't dead—just sleeping. The hot springs are warming slightly year by year. In another century, maybe two, the caldera might become unstable.\n\n**The Tide's Memory shrine**: Built by a people who lived here before the pirates. The stones have carvings in a language no one can read. Some say they warned of what sleeps below.\n\n### Hidden Factions\n\n**The Abolitionist Cell**: A small group wants to end slavery in the Isles. They help slaves escape, provide false papers, arrange passage to Veraheim. If discovered, they'd be killed. The leader is a human woman named **Coral** who runs a bathhouse.\n\n**The Loyalist Network**: Older captains who remember when The Storm first united the Isles. They're loyal to him, not the Monarchy. If Graza moves against The Storm, they'll side with him.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Murder in Harbor Peace** | Someone killed in Freehold. The Peace is broken. Graza must find the killer before the Confederation tears itself apart. |\n| **The Imperial Agent** | An elven spy has been captured. What they know could expose mainland connections—or start a war. |\n| **The Volcanic Warning** | Strange tremors. Fish dying. The hot springs getting hotter. Is something waking up? |\n| **The Abolitionists** | PCs discover the slave-escape network. Help them, or sell them out for profit? |\n| **Challenge to the Throne** | A captain is building alliances to challenge Graza. Does The Storm care?

What's inside? |\n\n### The Storm's Secret Presence\n\nVaelith Draegor doesn't just visit Freehold—he has eyes here permanently. Three of Graza's closest advisors report to him. The harbormaster owes him a life-debt. Two of the shore battery commanders served on *Sorrow*.\n\nHe knows everything that happens in Freehold. Graza suspects but can't prove it.
