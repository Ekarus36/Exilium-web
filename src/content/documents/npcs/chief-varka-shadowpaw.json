In a culture that values both, she's respected for seeing what others miss and advising well.\n\nShe's the voice of Mistwood at The Moot, the face outsiders meet at Trader's Edge, and the keeper of secrets even her own people don't know.

  "secretKnowledge": "### The Burden\n\nVarka carries the heaviest secret in the Broken Isles: she knows what's sealed beneath Mistwood.\n\n**What she learned:**\n- Found her grandmother's journal 20 years ago\n- Read the account of the deepest exploration\n- The island is a tomb, not a prison\n- Something sleeps below—vast, ancient, not quite dead\n\n**What she did:**\n- Burned the journal\n- Reinforced the seals\n- Established the Deepguard (permanent watchers)\n- Never told anyone the full truth\n\n**The weight:**\n- She's the only one who knows\n- She cannot share it (would cause panic)\n- She will die with this secret\n- Every night she wonders if she's done enough\n\n### The Deepguard\n\nThirty bugbears guard \"The Deep\"—a sealed ruin that officially doesn't exist.\n\n**What they know:** Guard duty is sacred. Never leave. Never speak of what you hear on bad nights.\n\n**What they don't know:** What they're actually guarding. Varka visits them every full moon. She tells them they protect the clan. She doesn't tell them from what.\n\n**The sounds:** On bad nights, sounds come from below. Not screams. Not voices. Something worse—a presence pressing against reality. The Deepguard have learned to ignore it. Mostly.\n\n### Vaelith Draegor\n\nThe Storm has sent agents to Mistwood. They keep dying.\n\n**Varka's position:** Guest-right is sacred. She hasn't killed them.\n\n**The truth:** She hasn't protected them either. The forest is dangerous. Agents who try to reach The Deep encounter... misfortune. The forest itself seems to reject them.\n\n**What she suspects:** The thing below doesn't want to be found. It protects its own sleep. This terrifies her more than anything.\n\n### The Skarath Crisis\n\nSkarath needs timber. Mistwood has timber. The Shadowpaw won't sell.\n\n**Varka's dilemma:**\n- The Shadowpaw way is sustainable\n- Clear-cutting would destroy the balance\n- But Skarath will die without wood\n- War between clans would tear the Confederation apart\n\n**Her private fear:** If war comes, she might have to reveal what's below. \"If you cut these trees, you might wake something.\" Would they believe her? Would it matter?\n\n### What She Wants\n\n**For herself:** To die knowing the seal holds.\n\n**For her people:** Continued safety, traditional ways preserved.\n\n**For the Isles:** The Confederation to survive without Mistwood being exploited.\n\n**Her impossible wish:** Someone to share the burden with. But who could she trust?\n\n### Her Assessment of Power Players\n\n**Vaelith Draegor:** Dangerous, too curious. His information network might eventually learn the truth. She's considered having him killed. She won't—but she's considered it.\n\n**Kozrek the Admiral:** Respects the sea; knows nothing of forests. Harmless to Mistwood.\n\n**The Mainland Powers:** Too far away to matter. Unless they decide Mistwood's resources are worth invasion.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Inheritance** | Varka is dying (she's 52—ancient for a bugbear). Who inherits her knowledge? Does she choose someone? Do PCs become involved? |\n| **The Seal Weakens** | Something's changed. The sounds are louder. The Deepguard are frightened. Does she finally tell someone? |\n| **The Timber War** | Skarath makes a move. Varka must prevent war without revealing why the forest truly cannot be touched. |\n| **The Storm's Discovery** | Vaelith finally gets an agent deep enough to learn something. What does he do with partial knowledge? |\n| **The Journal** | Varka burned it—but her grandmother wasn't the only explorer. Another copy might exist. |\n| **The Visitor** | Something from below... communicates. Not an attack. A message. What does it want? |\n\n---",
