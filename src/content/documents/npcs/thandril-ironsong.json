Never slouches, rarely blinks, always watching.\n\n### Personality (Public)\nProfessional to the point of intimidation. Speaks only when necessary, in short precise sentences. Shows no favoritism—lords and laborers receive the same assessment. Neither cruel nor kind; simply absolute in his duty. His approval is expressed through a slight nod. His disapproval needs no expression.\n\n### The Eternal Guard\n100 elite warriors protecting the Crown:\n- **The Spire Guard** (40): Interior of Eternal Spire\n- **The Plaza Watch** (40): Crown Plaza and tower approaches\n- **The Shadow Shield** (20): Plainclothes, embedded in crowds\n\nThandril commands all of them. He personally trains the officers. He interviewed every guard currently serving. His standards are legendary—only 1 in 50 applicants passes.\n\n### His Reputation\n- Stopped three assassination attempts personally (that are publicly known)\n- Once held the Throne Hall door alone for 20 minutes against insurgents\n- Has ejected nobles for disrespect (they didn't come back)\n- Is said to know every face that has ever entered the Crown\n- Even the Four Pillars speak to him with respect\n\n### Relationship with the Emperor\nHe sees Valandor daily. They rarely speak beyond protocol. But Thandril has protected the Emperor for 300 years. There is trust there that doesn't require words.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nThandril Ironsong is exactly what he appears to be: a perfect guardian. But perfection has a cost. He has sacrificed everything—family, ambition, personal desires—for one purpose: keeping the Emperor alive. He doesn't regret it. He doesn't know how to be anything else anymore.\n\nHe's not a fanatic. He doesn't worship Valandor. He simply made a choice 300 years ago, and he has honored it every day since. The choice has consumed him, defined him, become him. If Valandor died, Thandril isn't sure he'd know how to exist.\n\n### What He's Actually Stopped\nThe three public assassination attempts were minor. The real threats:\n- 7 magical attacks (dispelled before detonation)\n- 12 poisoning attempts (detected, poisoners quietly eliminated)\n- 3 insider betrayals (guards turned, dealt with privately)\n- 1 attack by a Pillar's agent (Thandril has never revealed which Pillar)\n\nHe keeps these secret because public knowledge would cause panic, damage trust, and encourage imitators. Only Valandor knows the true count.\n\n### His Network\nThe Eternal Guard isn't just the 100 visible soldiers. Thandril has:\n- **Informants** in every Great House\n- **Contacts** with Velindor Shadowmere (professional respect, mutual wariness)\n- **Agents** in the Outer City listening for threats\n- **Files** on everyone who regularly enters the Crown\n\nHe doesn't run spy operations—that's Shadowmere's domain. But he knows things. Things that help him protect.\n\n### The Weight of Duty\nThandril has never married. Never had children. Never taken a vacation. In 300 years, he has spent perhaps 100 days outside the Crown—and only when the Emperor left Aelindor.\n\nHe doesn't resent this. He chose it. But sometimes, in the quiet hours before dawn, he wonders what his life might have been. Then the sun rises, and he stops wondering. There's work to do.\n\n### His Opinion on the Pillars\nHe trusts none of them completely:\n- **Caerwyn**: Respects his competence; watches for military ambition\n- **Thaelorin**: Values his neutrality; concerned about what secrets he keeps\n- **Isileth**: Uncertain—her prophecies could be weapons or warnings\n- **Faendril**: Practical alliance; monitors his economic leverage\n\nOne of them may have sent that assassin 200 years ago. He's never forgotten.\n\n### What He Wants\n- To die before Valandor (so he never has to fail)\n- The Empire stable (his life's work validated)\n- Perhaps: to know his sacrifice mattered\n\n### What He Fears\n- Failing at the moment it matters most\n- Living after Valandor dies (what would he be?)\n- A threat he doesn't see coming\n- Being used as a weapon against the Emperor (hostages, manipulation)\n\n### His Judgment of Visitors\nWhen PCs enter the Crown, Thandril evaluates them:\n- **Combat capability**: Can they hurt anyone?\n- **Intentions**: What do they want?\n- **Connections**: Who sent them?\n- **Threat level**: Should they be watched?\n\nHe makes these assessments in seconds. He's rarely wrong.\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Gates** | PCs need access to the Crown. Thandril stands between them and their goal. |\n| **The Assassination** | He learns of a plot—but the source is a Pillar. He needs outside help. |\n| **The Retirement** | After 300 years, he's considering stepping down. The transition is dangerous. |\n| **The Past** | His own history—family, old comrades—catches up with him. |\n| **The Test** | He tests PCs before trusting them with sensitive information. |\n| **The Fall** | Valandor is attacked successfully. Thandril survives. What does he do next? |\n\n---",
