  "rawContent": "# Miravel Dawnseeker\n\n**Keeper of the Apex** | Imperial Inner Circle\n\n> *\"What happens above the Throne Hall is not discussed. Ever.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 280 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Female |\n| **Role** | Emperor's Personal Attendant |\n| **Reports To** | Emperor Valandor directly |\n| **Location** | Eternal Spire, upper levels |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nMiravel Dawnseeker is the only elf permitted in the Emperor's private chambers. She manages his personal needs, maintains his quarters, and has access to the Apex—the spire's mysterious top level. She's young for such a position, appointed just 50 years ago after her predecessor died.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nQuiet, efficient, utterly discreet. Appears at formal functions but never speaks unless addressed. Moves like a shadow through the Spire's upper levels. Her face reveals nothing; her eyes see everything. Those who've tried to bribe her for information have disappeared.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Youngest Keeper of the Apex in Imperial history\n- Only living elf who has seen the Spire's top level\n- Never speaks about her duties—contractually and magically bound\n- Selected personally by Valandor from hundreds of candidates\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nThe Apex contains something alive—she tends to it as part of her duties. Not Valandor, something else. She doesn't know what it is, only that it's ancient, that it requires care, and that the Emperor visits it nightly.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Emperor Valandor**: Master - Absolute loyalty\n- **Thandril Ironsong**: Security - Coordinates her protection\n- **Aerindel Silvarion**: Colleague - Both serve the Emperor directly\n",
