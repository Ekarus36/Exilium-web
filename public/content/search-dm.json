Noble, majestic, beautiful—and terrifying.\n\n    Behavior\nPerches on the peak above Veraheim during daylight (visible deterrent). Flies patrol circuits at dawn. Hunts in the wilderness every few days. Retires to his lair (cave below peak) at night. Does NOT interact with citizens—too intimidating. Only Thaelen and Vera visit him regularly.\n\n    Known Capabilities\n- Flight (faster than any horse, more mobile than any army)\n- Dragon breath (devastating cold and paralyzing gas)\n- Physical strength (can tear through fortifications)\n- 400 years of combat experience\n- Perfect coordination with Thaelen (telepathic bond)\n\n    Why No One Attacks Veraheim\nAny army approaching would face Thorongil. No force in Exilium can defeat an adult dragon with a skilled rider. Even if they could, losses would be catastrophic. Both the Thelassian and Aloria know this. So they don't try.\n\n    Relationship with Thaelen\nThe bond is legendary. 400 years together, survived the Dragon War side by side. Telepathic communication—they don't need words. Thorongil would burn the world to protect Thaelen.\n\n    Relationship with Ver","tier":"secret-knowledge"},{"slug":"vera-wyrdweaver","category":"npcs","title":"Vera Wyrdweaver","content":"  Vera Wyrdweaver   - Co-Ruler of Veraheim, \"The Lady,\" \"The Mountain Splitter\"\n\n- Human sorceress who co-founded Veraheim 80 years ago with an exiled elf\n- Most powerful magic user alive—split a mountain range to create the tunnel\n- Appears 30 despite being 100 years old (magic slows her aging)\n- Rules the neutral city that shelters refugees from both racist powers\n-  Common saying: \"The Lady holds the mountain.
