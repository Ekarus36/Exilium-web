They move through the island in family bands, hunting, killing monsters, and exploring ruins that predate the Confederation by millennia.\n\nIf you need monster parts, exotic pelts, or artifacts from the Old Places, you go to Trader's Edge on the coast and wait. The Shadowpaw will find you. They always do.\n\n*Common saying: \"The mist hides everything. The Shadowpaw hide better.\"*\n\n---",
  "commonKnowledge": "### Geography\n\nDense ancient forest covering 90% of the island. Perpetual mist in lower elevations. Rocky highlands with cave systems. Scattered ruins of unknown origin. Treacherous coastline, few natural harbors.\n\n**Key Areas:**\n- **The Deep Green**: Forest interior, dangerous to outsiders\n- **The Mist Valleys**: Low-lying fog zones, monster territory\n- **The Old Places**: Ancient ruins scattered throughout\n- **Grandmother's Cave**: Sacred gathering place, clan ceremonies\n- **The Broken Tower**: Largest ruin, partially explored\n- **Trader's Edge**: Only permanent structure, coastal trading post\n\n### The Shadowpaw Way\n\nThe clan doesn't live in one place. ~30 bands of 30-70 bugbears each move through the island following game, seasons, and opportunity. This isn't primitive—it's perfectly adapted.\n\n**Band Types:**\n- **Hunter Bands**: Game tracking, pelts, meat\n- **Slayer Bands**: Monster hunting\n- **Seeker Bands**: Ruin exploration, relics\n- **Watcher Bands**: Coastal patrol, trading\n\n**Seasonal Cycle:**\n- Spring: Bands disperse, hunting begins\n- Summer: Monster activity peaks, deep exploration\n- Autumn: Great Gathering at Grandmother's Cave\n- Winter: Bands shelter together, crafting season\n\n### Chief Varka Shadowpaw\n\nFemale bugbear, 52, respected for wisdom not strength. \"First among equals\"—advises, mediates, represents the clan, but can't command. Bands obey her because she's usually right.\n\n### Trade Goods\n\n**Exports:**\n- Monster parts (dragon scales, troll blood, hydra venom)\n- Exotic pelts and leathers\n- Ancient artifacts from the Old Places\n- Rare herbs and components\n- Guides through Mistwood (expensive)\n\n**The Process:** Go to Trader's Edge. Wait. They'll find you. Never go into the forest uninvited—you won't come out.\n\n### The Old Places\n\nAncient ruins dot the island—towers, foundations, carved caves. No one knows who built them. The Shadowpaw have explored them for generations and still find new chambers.\n\n**What they've found:** Strange artifacts, dormant constructs, writing in unknown languages, magic that still works.\n\n**What they don't share:** The most dangerous discoveries are sealed and watched. Some ruins are forbidden even to Shadowpaw.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### What Sleeps in Mistwood\n\nThe island was a colony of something. The ruins aren't random—they're a single complex, scattered and buried over millennia. Underground, they connect.\n\n**What the Shadowpaw know:**\n- The Old Places are connected below\n- Something was imprisoned here, long ago\n- Certain artifacts are keys; they destroyed most\n- The Broken Tower leads down, far down, to somewhere they've sealed\n\n**What they don't know:**\n- What the prisoners were\n- If they're still alive\n- What happens if the seals fail\n\nChief Varka's grandmother explored deeper than anyone. She came back changed—wiser, sadder, and absolutely certain the lowest levels must never be opened. She died refusing to explain why.\n\n### The Forbidden Ruin\n\nOne ruin—called simply \"The Deep\"—is absolutely forbidden. No Shadowpaw goes there. No outsider is told it exists.\n\n**What's there:** A sealed door that occasionally leaks something. Not light. Not sound. A *feeling* that makes even bugbears afraid.\n\n**Who guards it:** A permanent Watcher band, the Deepguard. Thirty bugbears who never leave. Their families bring supplies. They never speak of what they hear on bad nights.\n\n### Varka's Secret\n\nChief Varka found her grandmother's journal. She read what's in The Deep. She burned the journal—but she can't burn her memory.\n\n**What she knows:** The island isn't a prison. It's a tomb. And something down there isn't quite dead.\n\n**What she does:** Maintains the seals, refuses all expeditions below certain depths, and watches for signs of waking. She's told no one. The burden is hers alone.\n\n### The Storm's Interest\n\n[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) has never visited Mistwood. He's sent agents who reported back... then died within the year. Accidents. Illnesses. Coincidences.\n\n**Varka's doing?** She denies it. The Shadowpaw tradition says guest-right is sacred. But the drow's agents kept trying to reach The Deep. And they kept dying.\n\n**What The Storm suspects:** Something on Mistwood is worth hiding. He's patient. He'll learn eventually.\n\n### The Skarath Problem\n\nSkarath is running out of timber. They're looking at Mistwood's ancient forests. Chief Varka has refused all logging rights.\n\n**The tension:** Skarath needs timber or they die. The Shadowpaw won't sell their home. Both sides are right.\n\n**Coming conflict:** Within a generation, this will become a crisis. War between goblins and bugbears, with the entire Confederation forced to choose sides.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Seeker's Map** | A dying Seeker offers a map to the Broken Tower's lowest level. She says something there could save the Isles. Or doom them. |\n| **The Deepguard's Silence** | A young Deepguard abandoned his post and fled to Saltmere. He's terrified. What did he see? |\n| **The Logging War** | Skarath sends an \"exploratory expedition\" to assess Mistwood timber. The Shadowpaw see it as invasion. Prevent war or pick a side? |\n| **The Old Key** | An artifact surfaces in Saltmere. Varka recognizes it—it's a key to something sealed. She needs it recovered. Quietly. |\n| **The Storm's Patience** | Vaelith offers enormous payment for information about what Mistwood hides. Is knowing worth the risk? |\n| **The Waking Signs** | Earthquakes. Animals fleeing. Something below is stirring. Is it too late to stop it? |\n\n### Relationship with the Confederation\n\nThe Shadowpaw are members but barely. They attend The Moot (usually), trade with other settlements, and follow Harbor Peace. Beyond that, they keep to themselves.\n\n**Other settlements' view:** Mysterious, useful, unsettling. Everyone wants what Mistwood produces; no one wants to go there.\n\n**Shadowpaw view:** The Confederation is convenient. If it became inconvenient, they'd simply stop participating. The forest doesn't need anyone else.\n\n---",
