  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nPowerfully built, arms like tree trunks. Short-cropped black hair, military cut. Cold blue eyes that evaluate everyone as threat or tool. Scarred hands from years of smithing and fighting. Wears functional armor even at court. Short beard, kept trimmed. Speaks directly, almost rudely.\n\n### Personality\nDirect to the point of insult. Despises politics and scheming but participates when necessary. Values strength, courage, and loyalty above all. Believes humans should dominate through power, not diplomacy. Respects warriors regardless of birth. Impatient with weakness, soft words, and excuses.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Brunhilde (née Wolfstein, 35) - Lord Wolfstein's sister. Warrior herself, genuine partnership.\n- **Heir:** Konrad (17) - Talented fighter under immense pressure. Marriage discussions starting.\n- **Second Son:** Friedrich (15) - \"Disappointment,\" prefers books to swords. Father is oblivious to his value.\n- **Daughter:** Sigrid (12) - Wants to be a knight, trains secretly.\n\n### Domain & Strength\nRules ~12,000 people in the northern mountains. Controls the best iron mines in the Kingdom. Commands 3,000 soldiers—the best equipped in the Kingdom. Supplies weapons to the Royal Army (major leverage). Could theoretically embargo the Kingdom's arms supply.\n\n### Political Position\nLeads the Military Bloc alongside Wolfstein and (loosely) Thornwood. Thinks King Aldric is weak. Has been cultivating Prince Roderick—they share views on strength and glory. Married into Wolfstein, cementing the military alliance.\n\n---",
