  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nHalf-orc woman of commanding presence. Carries herself with the confidence of someone who earned her position through blood and cunning. Dresses in quality but practical clothing—wealth displayed without excess. Green-tinged skin, prominent but not grotesque tusks. Charismatic smile that can turn cold in an instant.\n\n### Personality\nPeople genuinely want to follow her—she has that quality. Remembers names, remembers debts, makes people feel valued. But cross her and the warmth vanishes. She's executed captains publicly for betrayal, and the executions were memorable. The balance between inspiration and intimidation is her art form.\n\n### Public Role\n- Presides over the Moot (quarterly captain meetings)\n- Settles disputes between captains\n- Maintains Freehold Harbor operations\n- Collects tribute from all captains\n- Commands the Queen's Guard (~200 warriors)\n\n### Known Relationships\n- **The Storm (Vaelith Draegor):** Everyone knows she rules within his tolerance. She sends him tribute he never asked for.\n- **Gorrath Bloodstone:** Fellow half-blood, strong ally. Orc clans support her.\n- **The Admiral (Kozrek):** Useful but exhausting. Pays tribute properly.\n- **The Rapier (Rennick):** Unpredictable, respects his skill.\n\n### The Coronation Story\nWhen Graza took the throne, Vaelith Draegor attended. Stood in the back. Said nothing. When she looked at him, he gave a small nod. Then left. That nod is why she's still Queen.\n\n---",
