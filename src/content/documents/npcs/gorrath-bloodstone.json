  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nMassive even for an orc. Dark green skin weathered by sea and sun. Prominent tusks, one capped with iron (battle trophy). Black hair in traditional warrior braids. Clan tattoos covering arms and chest—Bloodstone red and black. When he enters a room, smaller beings step aside instinctively.\n\n### Personality\nTraditional orc values adapted to sea warfare. Strength is respect. Honor in combat. Loyalty to clan above all. Leads from the front—always first to board. Shares danger with his warriors. Punishes cowardice, rewards bravery. His word is law, but he listens to clan elders.\n\n### The Clan Fleet\nUnlike other pirate fleets, the Clan Fleet is organized by blood ties:\n- **Bloodstone Ships (7):** Gorrath's clan, the larger faction\n- **Ironfang Ships (5):** Allied clan under Chief Mulga\n- **Blood Loyalty:** Crew are clansmen, not hires. Desertion almost unknown.\n\n### Combat Style\n- Get close, board, overwhelm with numbers\n- Orc warriors devastating in melee\n- Rams to lock vessels together\n- Minimal interest in cannon duels\n- \"Boarding actions are proper combat\"\n\n### Known Relationships\n- **Queen Graza:** Respects her strength, supports her at the Moot. Half-orc queen means orc influence.\n- **The Storm:** Deep respect, doesn't challenge him, sees him as honorable apex predator.\n- **The Rapier:** \"Prancing fool, but skilled.\"\n- **The Admiral:** \"Plays soldier, but his ships work.\"\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nGorrath is exactly what he appears—a traditional orc warchief who happens to fight on ships. The distinction between \"pirate\" and \"warchief conducting raids\" matters deeply to him. He's not complicated, but he's not simple either. Clan politics, ancestor honor, and warrior tradition shape every decision.\n\n### The Unification Story\nTwenty years ago, Bloodstone and Ironfang were at war. Gorrath challenged and killed the previous Bloodstone warchief, then made peace with Ironfang through marriage (his sister wed Mulga's son). United what had been divided for generations. The alliance is stable but requires constant maintenance.\n\n### Succession Concerns\nWhen Gorrath dies:\n- New warchief chosen by strength\n- Could be his son, could be a challenger\n- Ironfang might demand the position\n- Alliance could fracture\n- He's 51—not ancient, but front-line combat takes its toll\n\n### The Mainland Connection\nSome orc tribes still live on the mainland under human/elf oppression. The clan orcs consider themselves the free orcs. Occasional refugees reach the Isles and join the clans. Gorrath feels obligation to these mainland kin—might take risks to help them.\n\n### What They Don't Do\n- Slaving (orcs have strong feelings about captivity)\n- Attacking without purpose\n- Fighting losing battles (no honor in pointless death)\n- Breaking clan oaths\n\n### What He Wants\n- Clan prosperity and glory\n- Honor for ancestors\n- More warriors, more ships\n- Eventually: secure future for orc clans in the Isles\n\n### What He Fears\n- Alliance fracturing (Bloodstone/Ironfang conflict)\n- Dying without worthy successor\n- Clan honor being stained\n- Mainland orcs being wiped out while he does nothing\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Clan Feud** | Old grudge between Bloodstone and Ironfang resurfaces. Gorrath must prevent civil war. |\n| **Mainland Rescue** | Orc refugees need extraction. Dangerous and barely profitable. He'll do it anyway. |\n| **Succession Crisis** | Gorrath's son and his nephew (Ironfang) both claim succession rights. He's not dead yet, but people are choosing sides. |\n| **The Old Enemy** | Elves who participated in anti-orc actions are identified. Clan honor demands vengeance. |\n| **Skrag Problem** | The slaver captain crosses a line. Gorrath's patience ends. War between captains. |\n\n---",
