  "rawContent": "# Aelindra Songweaver\n\n**Lorekeeper of Arts** | Twilight Tower (Twilight Assembly)\n\n> *\"A culture that forgets its songs forgets itself.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 450 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Female |\n| **Role** | Keeper of Cultural Traditions |\n| **Reports To** | Starwarden Isileth |\n| **Location** | Twilight Tower, Cultural Levels |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nAelindra Songweaver preserves and promotes elven arts—music, poetry, theater, painting, sculpture. She curates the Empire's cultural treasures, approves performances at the Silver Amphitheater, and ensures traditions survive across centuries. She is the guardian of elven identity expressed through beauty.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nPassionate about art, dismissive of politics. Speaks in metaphors and quotes poetry mid-conversation. Can be pretentious but genuinely loves her work. Believes art is what separates elves from \"lesser\" races—their creativity spanning centuries rather than decades.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Has memorized every play performed at the Silver Amphitheater in 400 years\n- Composed three epic poems still performed today\n- Selects which artists receive Imperial patronage\n- Controls what cultural traditions are \"official\"\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nShe's discovered art from non-elven cultures that moves her—human ballads, dwarven stone-songs. She's collected samples secretly. Admitting beauty exists outside elven culture would be scandalous, but she can't stop herself from preserving it.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Isileth**: Superior - Cultural preservation serves diplomacy\n- **Caelindra enclave**: Professional - The Golden Wood is the artistic heart of the Empire\n- **Guild of Artists**: Oversight - Approves major commissions\n",
