  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance\nMassive silver dragon—38 feet long, 76-foot wingspan. Brilliant metallic scales that gleam in sunlight. Deep sapphire blue eyes, wise and penetrating. Battle scars visible: three claw marks across left shoulder, chipped horns, small tears in wing membranes. Noble, majestic, beautiful—and terrifying.\n\n### Behavior\nPerches on the peak above Veraheim during daylight (visible deterrent). Flies patrol circuits at dawn. Hunts in the wilderness every few days. Retires to his lair (cave below peak) at night. Does NOT interact with citizens—too intimidating. Only Thaelen and Vera visit him regularly.\n\n### Known Capabilities\n- Flight (faster than any horse, more mobile than any army)\n- Dragon breath (devastating cold and paralyzing gas)\n- Physical strength (can tear through fortifications)\n- 400 years of combat experience\n- Perfect coordination with Thaelen (telepathic bond)\n\n### Why No One Attacks Veraheim\nAny army approaching would face Thorongil. No force in Exilium can defeat an adult dragon with a skilled rider. Even if they could, losses would be catastrophic. Both the Thelassian and Aloria know this. So they don't try.\n\n### Relationship with Thaelen\nThe bond is legendary. 400 years together, survived the Dragon War side by side. Telepathic communication—they don't need words. Thorongil would burn the world to protect Thaelen.\n\n### Relationship with Vera\nTook decades to earn his trust. Now loves her independently of Thaelen. She visits him for counsel. He's fiercely protective of her. She can ride him (a privilege that took 30 years to earn).\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nThorongil is exactly the wise, fierce guardian he appears—but with depths of loneliness and regret that few understand. He chose his bond with Thaelen over his own species. He's been exiled from dragonkind for 400 years. The cost of love was everything else.\n\n### The Dragon War Legacy\nWhat he lived through:\n- 35 days of fighting his own kind\n- Watched dragon-elf bonds break and die\n- Killed dragons he knew to protect Thaelen\n- Survived because their bond held when others shattered\n- Considered traitor by all other dragons\n\n**The Truth:**\n- Dragons attacked believing ELVES tortured their kin\n- Actually DROW were responsible\n- War was fought on false premise\n- But Thorongil still fought dragons to save Thaelen\n- Even knowing the truth now, wouldn't change his choice\n- \"I chose my bond over my people. They're right to call me traitor.\"\n\n### Exile from Dragonkind\nCannot return to dragon society:\n- Dragons in the northwestern mountains (400 years, no contact)\n- They consider him ultimate traitor\n- If he returned, they'd likely attack\n- No one to speak Draconic with\n- Dragon culture and traditions maintained alone\n- Sometimes flies toward the mountains, stops before visible\n\n### His Role as Vera's Conscience\nShe visits 3-4 times weekly for \"evening conversations\":\n- Challenges her reasoning on difficult decisions\n- Points out blind spots she can't see\n- Validates her doubts (not weakness, wisdom)\n- Tells her when she's wrong (dragons don't lie)\n- He's the only one she told about the halfling girl\n\n**What He Told Her:**\n> \"You did what your heart demanded. The policy remained and you upheld it. Your heart and your head both have value. Do not silence either.\"\n\n### His Fears\n- **Losing Thaelen:** The bond might literally kill him. Thaelen has maybe 200-300 years left. Then what?\n- **Losing Vera:** Would devastate him independently now\n- **The After:** If both die, what does he do? Stay? Return to face death? Fly away alone?\n- **Meaninglessness:** Dragons don't fear death. They fear their existence having no purpose.\n\n### His Wisdom (Quotes for DM Use)\n\n**On Power:**\n> \"Power without purpose is destruction. You have both, Vera. Never lose the purpose.\"\n\n**On Time:**\n> \"Humans see a lifetime. Elves see ten. I see a hundred. None of us see eternity. We all make choices in the dark.\"\n\n**On the Floats:**\n> \"You cannot save everyone. This is truth. But you can save these 3,500. This is also truth. Both matter.\"\n\n**On Corruption:**\n> \"Tyrants do not question themselves. You ask every day if you've lost your way. This is how you know you haven't.\"\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Dragon Returns** | Other dragons appear near Veraheim. Do they want Thorongil dead—or forgiven? |\n| **The Truth Revealed** | Evidence proves drow (not elves) caused the Dragon War. Could this change anything? |\n| **Thorongil Injured** | The dragon is hurt or sick. Veraheim is suddenly vulnerable. |\n| **The Bond Threatened** | Something could sever the dragon-rider bond.
