  "secretKnowledge": "### His Origins\n\n**Father:** Old Lord Oswald Blackthorne\n**Mother:** Kitchen servant (died when Corvin was 8, \"fever\")\n\n**Childhood:**\n- Grew up knowing who his father was\n- Never acknowledged, never spoken to\n- Watched his legitimate half-brothers have everything\n- Learned to be invisible, to listen, to survive\n\n**The turning point:**\n- At 15, Edmund (then third son, 27) approached him secretly\n- \"We're alike, you and I. Neither of us will inherit anything.\"\n- \"But I'm going to change that. Would you like to help?\"\n\n### The Murders\n\nCorvin personally arranged the deaths of Edmund's brothers:\n\n**Brother Aldric (Hunting \"Accident\"):**\n- Corvin spooked the horses\n- Watched from the trees as Aldric was trampled\n- Felt nothing except satisfaction that the plan worked\n\n**Brother Gareth (Poison):**\n- Slow poison over weeks, mimicking fever\n- Corvin posed as a servant, administered doses\n- Harder than Aldric—Gareth was kind to servants\n- Did it anyway\n\n**Father Oswald:**\n- More poison, after watching both heirs die\n- \"Broken heart\" was the official story\n- Corvin visited the old man's deathbed\n- Said nothing. The old man never knew who killed him.\n\n**Evidence:** A servant saw Corvin near Gareth's chambers before he fell ill. That servant was paid to disappear—but might still be alive somewhere.\n\n### His Relationship with Edmund\n\n**What it is:**\n- The only genuine bond either of them has\n- Edmund trusts Corvin absolutely\n- Corvin would die for Edmund without hesitation\n\n**The complication:**\n- Edmund sees Corvin as useful and values him\n- But Edmund values nothing above himself\n- If Corvin became a liability, Edmund would dispose of him\n- Corvin knows this. He doesn't care.\n\n**Why it works:**\n- Edmund gave Corvin identity when he had none\n- \"Brother\" means everything to Corvin\n- The manipulation doesn't matter—the word does\n\n### His Current Operations\n\n**The Seraphina Watch:**\n- Knows she's documenting evidence\n- Reports to Edmund (who's waiting to see what she finds)\n- Has orders to kill her if she tries to escape\n- Conflicted—she's never been cruel to him\n\n**The Marcus Recruitment:**\n- Cultivating Marcus Ravenscar as Edmund instructed\n- Posing as a merchant contact\n- Feeding Marcus's ambitions, guiding him toward Edmund\n\n**The Network:**\n- Runs Edmund's underworld connections\n- Contacts in Saltmere through Delara's network (she doesn't know who he really is)\n- Manages the bandit operation that funds Edmund's military\n\n### What He Wants\n\n**Consciously:**\n- Edmund's approval\n- To be useful\n- The work to continue\n\n**Unconsciously:**\n- Recognition he'll never get publicly\n- To believe the murders were justified\n- For Edmund to truly see him as brother, not tool\n\n### His Weakness\n\n**Seraphina:** She's the only person in Blackthorne Tower who treats servants kindly. She once bandaged his hand without asking how he was hurt. He's supposed to kill her if she runs.\n\nHe doesn't know if he can.\n\n### If Edmund Falls\n\nCorvin's options:\n1. **Die fighting:** Most likely. He has nothing without Edmund.\n2. **Flee:** To where? He's wanted for three murders.\n3. **Serve the new order:** Seraphina might need an assassin. Would she take him?\n4. **Revenge:** Kill whoever destroyed Edmund, then... nothing.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Hunt** | Corvin is hunting someone the PCs care about. Stop him—or negotiate. |\n| **The Witness** | The servant who saw him exists. Find them before Corvin does. |\n| **The Offer** | Edmund tasks Corvin with recruiting/eliminating PCs. He offers alternatives. |\n| **The Seraphina Problem** | She's trying to escape. Corvin is ordered to stop her. He hesitates. |\n| **The Betrayal** | Edmund decides Corvin is a liability. For the first time, the hunter is hunted. |\n| **The Aftermath** | Edmund is dead. Corvin approaches the PCs. He has information. He wants... what? |\n\n---",
