  "rawContent": "# Exilium - World Geography\n\n**Type**: Continental landmass  \n**Name**: Exilium (\"Land of Exile\")  \n**Climate**: [To be determined]  \n**Dominant Powers**: [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian) (West), [Aloria](/factions/aloria) (East)  \n**Natural Barrier**: Central mountain range running north-south\n\n---\n\n## Major Geographic Features\n\n### The Central Mountains\n\n**Human Name**: **The Shieldwall**  \n**Elven Name**: **Ered Rhain** (Border Mountains)\n\n**Orientation**: Runs north-south through the continent\n- **Length**: Sufficient to separate two major civilizations\n- **Height**: Peaks reach significant elevation (500+ ft cliffs common)\n- **Composition**: Brown/tan stone mountains\n- **Function**: Natural barrier between [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian) and [Aloria](/factions/aloria)\n\n**Key Location**: [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) sits in the central pass of this range\n\n---\n\n### The Northwestern Mountains (Dragon Territory)\n\n**Elven Name**: **Ered Thîl** (Shining/Gleaming Mountains)  \n**Human Name**: None - too remote, deep in elven territory\n\n**Location**: Far northwest of the continent, deep within [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian) territory\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Grey/silver peaks (taller and more forbidding than central range?)\n- Remote and isolated\n- Difficult terrain\n\n**Inhabitants**: \n- **Dragons** populate these mountains\n- No contact with elves for 400 years (since [The Elves-Dragon War](/history/the-elves-dragon-war))\n- [Thorongil (Vaethor)](/npcs/thorongil-vaethor) is considered a traitor by these dragons\n- Unknown if any bonded dragons remain besides Thorongil\n\n**Access**: \n- How far from civilization?\n- Deliberately avoided by both powers?\n- [Details to be developed]\n\n---\n\n## Political Geography\n\n### Western Territory: [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian)\n\n**Capital**: **[Aelindor](/geography/aelindor-the-eternal-city)** (large red settlement, central-west)\n- Seat of Emperor [Valandor Aethril](/npcs/emperor-valandor-aethril)\n- Location of the [Four Pillars](/factions/thelassian#The Four Pillars)\n- Seat of imperial power for 1,500 years\n- Ancient elven city, grand architecture\n- **14 days walking** from [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary)\n\n**Settlements**: Approximately 8-10 elven settlements (Enclaves)\n- Red/crimson architecture distinctive of elven construction\n- Scattered throughout western territory\n- Each Enclave sends a Speaker to regional councils\n- [Individual names TBD]\n\n**Terrain**: \n- Northwestern mountains (dragon territory)\n- Plains and forests [details TBD]\n- Western extent of territory [TBD]\n\n---\n\n### Eastern Territory: [Aloria](/factions/aloria)\n\n**Capital**: **Thornreich** (large golden castle, far east)\n- Seat of the human ruler [name TBD]\n- Government structure [TBD]\n- Golden castle with fortified walls\n- Medieval architecture (English/French/German influences)\n- **14 days walking** from [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary)\n\n**Regional Structure**: 11 Lords' Castles\n- Brown/tan castle architecture\n- Each lord controls a region?\n- Feudal system? Or different structure?\n- [Names and details TBD]\n\n**Settlements**: \n- The capital and 11 lord castles are most prominent\n- Additional villages/towns not shown on map\n- More spread out than elven settlements\n\n**Terrain**:\n- Eastern extent [TBD]\n- Plains, forests? [TBD]\n\n---\n\n### Central Territory: [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary)\n\n**Location**: Central mountain pass, exactly between the two powers\n\n**Architecture**: Blue-roofed castle, distinctive from both powers\n\n**Geographic Position**:\n- Carved into central mountains at 500ft elevation\n- Harbor directly south at sea level\n- Natural mountain peak above (Thorongil's perch)\n\n**Strategic Importance**: Controls the only safe passage between east and west\n\n---\n\n## Distances & Travel Times\n\n### From Veraheim to Capitals\n\n**[Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) to Elven Capital (West)**:\n- **14 days on foot**\n- Through western territories\n- Presumably using the tunnel exit and then traveling west\n- [Road conditions? Terrain? TBD]\n\n**[Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) to Human Capital (East)**:\n- **14 days on foot**  \n- Through eastern territories\n- From tunnel exit traveling east\n- [Road conditions? Terrain? TBD]\n\n**Note**: Veraheim is **perfectly equidistant** from both capitals - symbolic of its neutral position\n\n---\n\n### The Tunnel Through Veraheim\n\n**Length**: **Full day to cross** (walking)\n- Approximately 8-12 hours of travel time\n- Ground level passage beneath the city\n- East entrance → West entrance (or vice versa)\n- Well-lit and maintained by Veraheim guards\n- Regular patrol stations\n- Rest stops? [TBD]\n\n**Why so long**: \n- Mountains are MASSIVE\n- Not a straight line? (curves for stability?)\n- Multiple chambers/guard stations slow travel?\n- [Exact reason TBD]\n\n---\n\n### Total Cross-Continental Travel\n\n**Human Capital to Elven Capital** (via tunnel):\n- **25 days total walking**\n  - Human Capital → Tunnel East: 14 days\n  - Tunnel crossing: 1 day  \n  - Tunnel West → Elven Capital: 14 days\n- This assumes using the tunnel (safest route)\n\n**Without tunnel**:\n- Over/around mountains: Weeks to months longer\n- Extremely dangerous\n- Most caravans won't attempt it\n- This is why Veraheim's tunnel is economically crucial\n\n---\n\n### Travel Considerations\n\n**By Foot**: Times listed above (standard caravan pace)\n\n**By Horse**: \n- Faster, but how much? (2x speed = ~12 days?)\n- Can horses traverse tunnel easily?\n- [TBD]\n\n**By Dragon** (if you had one):\n- Veraheim to either capital: Hours? Single day?\n- This is why <span class=\"broken-link\" title=\"Page not found: Galdor Ruincalen\">Galdor Ruincalen</span> and [Thorongil (Vaethor)](/npcs/thorongil-vaethor) are so valuable\n- Neither power can match this mobility\n\n**By Ship** (to Veraheim):\n- From coastal cities to Veraheim harbor\n- Then up the South Lift\n- Depends on where ships come from [TBD]\n\n---\n\n## Coastline & Maritime\n\n### The Southern Coast\n\n**Veraheim Harbor**:\n- Primary port facility\n- Directly south of Veraheim\n- Natural harbor?\n- Protected waters?\n\n**The Floating Docks**:\n- Visible as ships anchored offshore\n- South of the harbor\n- Lawless floating settlement\n- No official recognition\n\n**Other Coastal Features**:\n- Does coastline extend east/west?\n- Other ports in Empire or Kingdom?\n- Islands? [mentioned in early notes but not visible on map]\n- [TBD]\n\n---\n\n## Climate & Biomes\n\n[To be developed - questions:]\n- What climate zones?\n- Forests? Deserts? Plains?\n- Seasonal variation?\n- How does geography affect climate?\n\n---\n\n## Unknown Territories\n\n### Beyond the Map Edges\n\n**North**: \n- Where do the mountains end?\n- Other lands beyond?\n- Dragon mountains extend how far?\n\n**South**: \n- Ocean extent?\n- Other continents?\n- Islands?\n\n**East** (beyond Aloria):\n- More human lands?\n- Other civilizations?\n- Where do the 11 lords' territories end?\n\n**West** (beyond Thelassian):\n- Ocean? More land?\n- Where does Empire's control end?\n- Northwestern mountains are here\n\n---\n\n## The Mentioned Islands\n\nIn early notes, you mentioned: \"Other races either live as second-class citizens or have small colonies in the neighboring islands.\"\n\n**Questions**:\n- Where are these islands?\n- South in the ocean?\n- Visible on map but not detailed?\n- Which races live there?\n- [Major development needed]\n\n---\n\n## To Name (Priority Order)\n\n**Immediate**:\n1. Thelassian capital city\n2. Aloria capital city\n3. The central mountain range\n4. The northwestern mountains (dragon territory)\n\n**Secondary**:\n5. Major elven Enclaves (2-3 prominent ones)\n6. Human lords' castles (or regional names)\n7. Geographic features (rivers, forests, etc.)\n\n**Later**:\n8. The islands (once we develop them)\n9. Minor settlements\n10. Roads, passes, other features\n\n---\n\n## Map Notes\n\nBased on the visual map provided:\n- Clear political division: Red (elves) vs Brown/Gold (humans)\n- Veraheim: Distinctive blue roofs, neutral coloring\n- Mountain ranges: Natural barriers\n- Floating docks: Visible as ships in water\n- Scale: Approximately 25 days walking across the continent\n\n**The map emphasizes**: Distance, separation, and Veraheim's strategic centrality\n",
