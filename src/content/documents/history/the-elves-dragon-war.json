  "commonKnowledge": "### Before the War: The Sacred Bonds\n\nFor millennia, dragons chose elven partners through spontaneous, mutual bonds—like falling in love. No one could force it. No one understood why some elves were chosen and others weren't.\n\n**Dragon Riders** became **Dragon Knights**: elite warriors who protected both species. The dragons lived in the northwestern mountains, their bond with elves the foundation of Imperial power.\n\n**The Drow Problem**: No dragon ever chose a drow. The reasons were unknown—perhaps cultural, perhaps something deeper. This exclusion bred resentment.\n\n### The War Itself\n\n**Day 1**: Elder dragons attacked the Empire without warning. They believed elves had been capturing and torturing their kind.\n\n**The Impossible Choice**: Bonded dragons had to choose—their riders or their species. Most bonds broke under the strain. Some dragons died defending their elven partners. Others fled rather than fight either side.\n\n**35 Days of Devastation**: Dragons who had never fought elves burned cities. Dragon Knights who had only ever defended dragons now killed them. The Empire nearly broke.\n\n**The Sole Survivors**: Thaelen Ruincalen and his dragon won every engagement without killing a single dragon—beating attackers into retreat through superior skill. To dragons, this made Thorongil a traitor. To elves, it made Thaelen irreplaceable.\n\n### The Discovery\n\nYears of investigation revealed the truth:\n- **Drow** had captured young dragons\n- **Drow** had tortured them trying to force bonds\n- **Drow** had caused the war\n- **Dragons** had attacked the wrong enemy\n\n### The Genocide Decree\n\nEmperor Valandor's response: **Kill all drow. Everywhere. Forever.**\n\n400 years later, the policy continues. Drow are killed on sight in Imperial territory. No investigation. No trial. Being drow is sufficient crime.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Truth Valandor Hides\n\nThe official history is incomplete.\n\n**What really happened:**\n- The conflict started as a territorial dispute between drow and elves\n- Both sides committed atrocities in the early stages\n- The drow dragon-torture was real but was **retaliation**, not unprovoked\n- Elves struck first\n- The genocide was born from rage and shame, not justice\n\n**Who knows:**\n- Valandor (he ordered the cover-up)\n- [Velindor Shadowmere](/npcs/velindor-shadowmere) (buried the evidence)\n- [Thaelorin](/npcs/first-remembrancer-thaelorin) (suspects but won't investigate)\n- Thaelen Ruincalen (discovered it; fled rather than live the lie)\n\n**Why it matters:** The Empire's moral foundation rests on \"righteous vengeance.\" If the truth emerged—that elves provoked the war—400 years of genocide become just... murder.\n\n### What Thaelen Found\n\n[Thaelen Ruincalen](/npcs/thaelen-ruincalen) didn't defect just for love. He found records in the Living Archive proving elves attacked first.\n\n**His choice:** Stay and live a lie, serving an empire built on hidden crimes—or leave with the woman he loved and the dragon who chose him.\n\n**He chose to leave.** He took his dragon—the last bonded dragon in the Empire—and never looked back.\n\n### The Dragons' Perspective\n\nThe elder dragons know the full truth now. They've known for centuries.\n\n**Why they haven't reconciled:**\n- The drow tortured their children (unforgivable regardless of provocation)\n- The elves lied about their role (trust is impossible)\n- Thorongil chose an elf over his species (treason to dragon-kind)\n- Too much blood, too much pain, too much time\n\n**The dragon position:** \"We were all betrayed. The bonds are dead. Leave us alone.\"\n\n### The Drow's Truth\n\nThe drow who ordered the torture are long dead. Modern drow inherit guilt for crimes they didn't commit.\n\n**What most drow believe:** \"We made a terrible mistake centuries ago. We've paid for it ever since.\"\n\n**What a few radicals believe:** \"The elves started it. Our ancestors were defending themselves.\"\n\n**The uncomfortable reality:** Both are partially true.\n\n### Could Reconciliation Happen?\n\n**With dragons:**\n- Thaelen and Thorongil are the only bridge\n- Young dragons who never experienced the war might be curious\n- But elders still rule dragon society\n- Unlikely in current generation\n\n**With drow:**\n- Would require Valandor to admit the cover-up\n- Would require acknowledging elves share blame\n- Would mean 400 years of genocide were... what?\n- Politically impossible while Valandor lives\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Archive Breach** | Someone accessed Thaelorin's sealed records.
