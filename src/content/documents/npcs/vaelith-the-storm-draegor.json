  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nWhite hair, long, salt-crusted. Skin pale gray—centuries of salt and sun faded typical drow obsidian to something ghostly. Eyes washed-out violet, almost white. Lean and wiry, moves with unsettling stillness. He stands like the sea before a hurricane—calm, patient, inevitable. He doesn't look like a drow anymore. He looks like what the sea made from one.\n\n### Personality\nSpeaks softly, rarely more than necessary. Long silences don't bother him. Watches everything, reacts to little. When he does speak, conversations stop. Smiles rarely; when he does, it doesn't reach his eyes. No warning when violence comes. No threats. No posturing. One moment still; the next, blood.\n\n### The Legend\n- **300 years old.** Three. Hundred. Years.\n- **His ship is alive.** *Sorrow* thinks. It hungers.\n- **The Empire bounty:** 500,000 gold pieces. Never claimed.\n- **47 naval hunters assigned.** All dead or retired in disgrace.\n- **Founded the Isles confederation** 118 years ago\n\n### *Sorrow* - The Sentient Ship\nAncient beyond knowing. Faster than any ship has a right to be. Can sense vessels before they appear on the horizon. Repairs itself. Vaelith and *Sorrow* share a psychic bond—they found each other 300 years ago, both broken, both alone.\n\n### The Thenn Lesson\nSixty years ago, a captain accidentally damaged *Sorrow* while drunk. Vaelith killed him. Then his brother. Then spent three months hunting down his entire family. **The Thenn family no longer exists.** No one has touched *Sorrow* since.\n\n### Relationship with Queen Graza\nShe rules by his tolerance. He attended her coronation, gave a small nod, left. That nod is why she's still Queen. She sends him tribute he never asked for. He accepts without comment. Her only safety is his indifference.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nVaelith was broken 300 years ago in the dark beneath the mountains. He and *Sorrow* put each other back together, imperfectly, into something new. He doesn't want power, legacy, or revenge—revenge implies an end. He will never be satisfied. He wants the sea, his ship, and Empire vessels burning until the Empire is ash.\n\n### The Massacre of Vel'thara\n300 years ago, his home—a hidden drow city of 3,000—was found and exterminated by the Empire. Systematic. Thorough. His mother Ilaena killed defending children. His sister Nhilaya, fourteen, never found. Everyone he'd known since birth—ash and memory.\n\nHe was seventeen. Found an underground river. Should have died. Woke in a cavern where an ancient, forgotten ship had waited in the dark for centuries. They needed each other.\n\n### The Psychic Bond\n*Sorrow* feels Vaelith's emotions; he feels its hungers. 300 years together, never apart for more than hours. When Empire ships appear, he feels *Sorrow* wake up. Feel it wanting. The ship is not a tool. It's his partner. His only companion.\n\n### His Code\n**Empire Ships:**\n- No surrender accepted\n- No survivors\n- Cargo burned with the ship\n- This isn't piracy. It's war.\n- 300 years. Thousands of ships. Never enough.\n\n**Other Targets:**\n- Standard rules—surrender and live\n- Professional, not cruel\n- Takes cargo, releases cooperative crews\n- Nothing personal\n\n### Rare Emotions\n**Anger:** Cold, not hot. Gets quieter. Stiller. Temperature seems to drop. Then violence—sudden, overwhelming.\n\n**Peace:** Open water. No land in sight. *Sorrow* beneath him. In these moments, he's almost content. Memories of Vel'thara fade. His mother's face blurs. His sister's voice goes quiet. Just the sea, the ship, silence. It never lasts. But it's enough.\n\n### What Would Make Him Act\n**Would fight for:**\n- The Broken Isles (external invasion)\n- Harbor Peace (fundamental to Isles)\n- *Sorrow* (absolute)\n\n**Would not care about:**\n- Who sits on throne\n- Captain rivalries\n- Politics of any kind\n\n**If challenged:** They would learn why no one does.\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Storm Acts** | Something makes Vaelith care about politics. What could possibly matter enough? |\n| **Empire Revenge** | The Empire sends something new. Something that might actually threaten him. |\n| **The Ship's Memory** | *Sorrow* remembers something from before. Ancient secrets from forgotten seas. |\n| **The Storm Speaks** | Vaelith actually gives the Queen an order. The Isles hold their breath. |\n| **Family Found** | A rumor: his sister Nhilaya might have survived. He would burn the world to know. |\n\n---",
