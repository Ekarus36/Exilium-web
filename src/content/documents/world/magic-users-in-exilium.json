  "rawContent": "# Magic Users in Exilium\n\n## Overview\n\nMagic in Exilium takes many forms - innate power, learned study, divine blessing, natural connection, and skilled talent. How each society treats magic users varies dramatically, creating a complex landscape where the same abilities might make you celebrated in one land and hunted in another.\n\n---\n\n## Magic User Types\n\n### Sorcerers (Innate/Arcane)\n\n**The Power:** Born with innate magical ability - magic flows through their blood.\n\n**Frequency:** Approximately 1 in 1,000 people are born with sorcerous potential.\n\n**By Society:**\n\n| Society | Term | Treatment |\n|---------|------|-----------|\n| [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian) | \"Naturals\" | Valued, trained, integrated into society |\n| [Aloria](/factions/aloria) | \"Abominations\" | Feared, hunted, must hide or die |\n| [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) | Sorcerers | Treated equally, judged by contribution |\n| [The Broken Isles](/factions/the-broken-isles) | Sorcerers | Welcomed, useful for ships and combat |\n\n**Detection:**\n- [Thorongil](/npcs/thorongil-vaethor) can sense the moment sorcerous power first manifests\n- No other reliable detection method exists\n- After initial manifestation, sorcerers are indistinguishable from wizards\n- This allows Aloria sorcerers to hide among wizard nobility\n\n**Population Estimates:**\n- Thelassian (~50,000 pop): ~50 sorcerers\n- Aloria (~300,000 pop): ~300 sorcerers (most hidden or dead)\n- Veraheim (~3,500 pop): ~3 sorcerers\n- Aelindor (~50,000 pop): ~50 sorcerers\n\n---\n\n### Wizards (Learned/Arcane)\n\n**The Power:** Magic learned through years of study, research, and practice.\n\n**By Society:**\n\n| Society | Access | Status |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian) | Open to all elves | Common, respected profession |\n| [Aloria](/factions/aloria) | Nobles only | Symbol of aristocratic power |\n| [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) | Open to all | Judged by contribution like everyone |\n| [The Broken Isles](/factions/the-broken-isles) | Anyone who can learn | Useful, no restrictions |\n\n**Training:**\n- Requires years of dedicated study\n- Empire has formal academies\n- Kingdom restricts to noble houses (private tutors)\n- Veraheim has informal mentorships and small schools\n\n**Population Estimates:**\n- Thelassian military: 1,000-1,250 wizards (20-25% of 5,000 soldiers)\n- Thelassian civilian: Thousands more\n- Aloria total: ~500-1,000 wizards (nobles only)\n- Veraheim: ~30-50 wizards\n\n**Military Impact:**\nThis disparity explains the military stalemate:\n- Human army: 250-500 casters in 25,000 soldiers (1-2%)\n- Elven army: 1,000-1,250 casters in 5,000 soldiers (20-25%)\n- Despite 5:1 numerical advantage, humans can't overcome magical superiority\n\n---\n\n### Clerics (Divine)\n\n**The Power:** Magic granted through faith and devotion to the divine.\n\n**Social Perception:** **Normal religious outcome** - not seen as \"magic users\" but as \"blessed\" or \"chosen.\"\n\n**By Society:**\n- All societies accept and respect divine casters\n- Clerics serve temples and communities\n- Seen as connection to the divine, not wielders of power\n- **All religions produce clerics** (since all gods are one God with different names)\n\n**Training:**\n- Temple service and devotion\n- Most temples train promising faithful for free\n- Years of religious education and practice\n\n---\n\n### Paladins (Divine)\n\n**The Power:** Divine magic combined with martial prowess - holy warriors.\n\n**Social Perception:** Highly respected as champions of faith.\n\n**Key Difference from Clerics:**\n- **Only some religions produce paladins**\n- Requires martial tradition within the faith\n- Rarer than clerics\n- More militant interpretation of divine service\n\n**Which religions have paladins?** [To be developed]\n\n---\n\n### Bards (Skill/Arcane)\n\n**The Power:** Magic woven through performance, music, and artistic expression.\n\n**Social Perception:** **Talented entertainers** - their magic is seen as exceptional skill, not \"real\" magic.\n\n**By Society:**\n- Accepted everywhere as skilled performers\n- Not considered \"magic users\" in the threatening sense\n- Similar social status to master craftsmen\n- Welcome in courts, taverns, and festivals\n\n---\n\n### Rangers (Skill/Nature)\n\n**The Power:** Magic derived from deep wilderness expertise and natural connection.\n\n**Social Perception:** **Survival skills** - their abilities are seen as extreme talent, not magic.\n\n**By Society:**\n- Valued as scouts, hunters, and guides\n- Not considered \"magic users\"\n- Respected in frontier regions\n- Common in all societies that border wilderness\n\n---\n\n### Druids (Nature)\n\n**The Power:** Deep connection to natural forces and the living world.\n\n**Social Perception:** Mysterious but not threatening - as long as they stay away.\n\n**Lifestyle:**\n- **Live in circles away from civilization**\n- Prefer isolation from urban life\n- **Avoid using nature magic in public**\n- Not persecuted, but not integrated either\n\n**Relationship with Veraheim:**\n- **No druids live in Veraheim** (city life conflicts with their nature)\n- [Vera](/npcs/vera-wyrdweaver) has good relationships with most druid circles\n- Druids occasionally visit for consultation\n- Mutual respect between Vera and circle leaders\n\n**Druid Circles:** [Locations and philosophies to be developed]\n\n---\n\n### Warlocks (Pact)\n\n**The Power:** Magic granted through pacts with extraplanar entities.\n\n**Current Status:** **DO NOT EXIST YET**\n\n**Why:**\n- The Great Storm blocks contact with extraplanar beings\n- No celestials, fiends, or other entities can reach the mortal world\n- No pacts can be formed\n- **Warlocks will appear after the Great Storm is broken**\n\n**Future Implications:** [To be developed when/if the Storm breaks]\n\n---\n\n## Social Perception by Magic Type\n\n### Openly Accepted Everywhere\n- **Divine magic** (clerics/paladins) - \"Blessed by the gods\"\n- **Skill magic** (bards/rangers) - \"Exceptionally talented\"\n\n### Depends on Society\n- **Arcane learned** (wizards) - Empire welcomes, Kingdom restricts to nobles\n- **Arcane innate** (sorcerers) - Empire trains, Kingdom hunts\n\n### Keep Private Everywhere\n- **Nature magic** (druids) - Practitioners avoid civilization anyway\n- **Necromancy** - Legal but deeply taboo, don't practice publicly\n- **Transformation magic** - Legal but makes people uncomfortable\n\n---\n\n## Magic Taboos\n\n### Necromancy\n\n**Legal Status:** Legal in all three powers\n**Social Status:** Deeply taboo everywhere\n\n**In Practice:**\n- Don't practice publicly\n- Private research tolerated\n- Using it openly = social pariah\n- Not illegal, but you'll be shunned\n- Even in the Thelassian, necromancers work quietly\n\n### Transformation Magic\n\n**Legal Status:** Legal everywhere\n**Social Status:** Makes people uncomfortable\n\n**What Counts:**\n- Polymorph spells\n- Wild Shape (druid ability)\n- Disguise Self and similar illusions\n- Any magic that changes appearance\n\n**In Practice:**\n- Not restricted or illegal\n- People just prefer you don't do it around them\n- Creates unease and distrust\n- \"How do I know you're really you?\"\n\n---\n\n## No Magic Detection\n\n**Critical Rule:** There is no reliable way to detect if someone is a magic user.\n\n**Implications:**\n- Must witness someone casting to know they're a caster\n- Or know their training/background\n- Sorcerers can completely hide after initial manifestation\n- Creates paranoia in the Aloria\n- Noble wizards might secretly be sorcerers (no way to tell)\n\n**The Exception:**\n- [Thorongil](/npcs/thorongil-vaethor) can sense sorcerous manifestation\n- But only at the moment of first awakening\n- Doesn't work on wizards (learned, not innate)\n- Limited range (within ~5 miles when actively searching)\n- Automatic within Veraheim itself\n\n---\n\n## Multiclassing Implications\n\n### Wizard/Cleric Multiclass\n- Completely acceptable\n- Seen as scholarly priest or faithful mage\n- No social stigma in any society\n\n### Noble Wizard Who Manifests as Sorcerer\n- **Not automatically executed** (unlike discovered sorcerer peasants)\n- **No one would know** - indistinguishable from wizard after manifestation\n- Noble could hide sorcerous nature by claiming wizard training\n- Creates perfect cover story\n- Potential for blackmail if discovered\n- Explains why some nobles might secretly support sorcerer rights\n\n---\n\n## Magic in Each Society\n\n### Thelassian\n\n**Philosophy:** Magic is natural, should be cultivated and studied.\n\n- All magic types openly practiced\n- Wizards most common (elves have centuries to study)\n- Sorcerers (\"Naturals\") valued and formally trained\n- Divine casters serve the pantheon\n- Even necromancy researched (privately, discretely)\n- Magic integrated into military, government, daily life\n\n### Aloria\n\n**Philosophy:** Magic is power, and power must be controlled.\n\n- Divine magic (clerics/paladins) most respected - connection to gods\n- Wizards restricted to nobility - symbol of aristocratic power\n- Sorcerers hunted and killed - uncontrolled power is dangerous\n- Bards/Rangers accepted - seen as talented, not magical\n- Necromancy legal but socially devastating\n- Magic = political power, must stay in noble hands\n\n### Veraheim\n\n**Philosophy:** All are judged by contribution, including magic users.\n\n- All magic types equally welcome\n- No restrictions based on magic source\n- Even necromancers tolerated if discrete\n- Smaller population = fewer total casters\n- Druids won't live here (city conflicts with their nature)\n- Sorcerers safe from Kingdom persecution\n- Wizards can study regardless of birth\n\n### The Broken Isles\n\n**Philosophy:** If you're useful, you're welcome.\n\n- All magic types accepted\n- Casters valuable for ship combat and defense\n- No social stigma for any magic type\n- Practical approach - what can you do for the crew?\n- [Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) doesn't care what kind of magic you use\n\n---\n\n## Sorcerer Persecution in the Aloria\n\n### Why Sorcerers Are Feared\n- Power they didn't earn or study for\n- Cannot be controlled by noble education system\n- Might arise in any family, any class\n- Threatens noble monopoly on magical power\n- Religious justification: \"unnatural,\" \"tainted blood\"\n\n### How Sorcerers Are Discovered\n- Witnesses see manifestation (often dramatic, uncontrolled)\n- Childhood accidents revealing power\n- Someone reports suspicious abilities\n- Torture/interrogation of suspected families\n- No magical detection method exists\n\n### Consequences\n- Execution (most common)\n- Exile (if discovered noble - quietly removed)\n- Imprisonment and experimentation (rare, rumored)\n- Forced service (very rare - too dangerous)\n\n### Survival Strategies\n- Hide among wizards (claim noble training)\n- Flee to Veraheim or the Broken Isles\n- Never use powers openly\n- Join druid circles (nature magic acceptable cover)\n- Die\n\n### Do Any Lords Harbor Sorcerers?\n[To be developed - potential plot hooks]\n\n---\n\n## Vera's Druid Connections\n\n[Vera](/npcs/vera-wyrdweaver) maintains good relationships with most druid circles despite Veraheim being a city.\n\n**Why:**\n- Mutual respect for outcasts and those who don't fit\n- Vera's own connection to nature through her magic\n- Political alliance against common enemies\n- Druids appreciate Veraheim's environmental policies\n- [Further development possible]\n\n**In Practice:**\n- Druid circles send envoys occasionally\n- Vera consults them on natural matters\n- Some druids visit Veraheim (briefly)\n- Emergency alliance if either threatened\n- Exchange of knowledge and rare materials\n\n---\n\n## Questions for Future Development\n\n1. **Which religions produce paladins?** Militant faiths only? Specific gods?\n2. **Druid circle locations and philosophies?** Mountains? Forests? Different approaches?\n3. **Lords who secretly harbor sorcerers?** Political intrigue potential\n4. **Veraheim magical education costs?** Scholarships? Apprenticeships?\n5. **What happens when the Great Storm breaks?** Warlock emergence, planar contact\n\n---\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [Religion System](/world/religion-in-exilium-the-one-god-many-names)\n- [Magic Items System](/world/magic-items-in-exilium)\n- [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian)\n- [Aloria](/factions/aloria)\n- [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary)\n- [The Broken Isles](/factions/the-broken-isles)\n- [Vera Wyrdweaver](/npcs/vera-wyrdweaver)\n- [Thorongil (Vaethor)](/npcs/thorongil-vaethor)\n",
