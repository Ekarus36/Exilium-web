  "commonKnowledge": "### The Crisis\n\nA catastrophe threatened the mountain pass—the vital trade route between the Thelassian and Aloria was collapsing. Avalanches, earthquakes, something unstable in the deep rock. Travelers were dying. Trade was stopping.\n\n### The Meeting\n\n**Thaelen Ruincalen**—the last Dragon Knight with an intact bond—was dispatched by the Empire. His official mission: investigate the crisis. His secret mission: eliminate Vera Wyrdweaver, a human sorceress the Empire considered a threat.\n\nWhen he found her, she was in the midst of the disaster, using her power to save lives. Elven lives. Human lives. Anyone trapped in the collapse.\n\nThaelen had a choice: complete his mission or help her save people. He chose honor over orders.\n\n### The Love\n\nIn the aftermath, saving lives together, they fell in love. The dragon rider and the sorceress. The elf and the human. The Empire's greatest weapon and the Kingdom's most powerful mage.\n\nThorongil—Thaelen's dragon—approved. He recognized something in Vera: a spirit as fierce as any dragon's.\n\n### The Outrage\n\nBoth powers reacted with fury:\n\n**The Thelassian:** Accused Vera of using enchantment to seduce their champion. Demanded Thaelen's return. Called Vera a witch and a threat.\n\n**The Aloria:** Accused the elves of kidnapping their greatest sorceress. Demanded Vera's return. Called the Empire traitors and liars.\n\n### The Hunt\n\nBoth powers sent forces to capture the pair. Soldiers died. Knights died. Dragon Knights died—against Thorongil, they had no chance.\n\nThe violence was senseless. The politics were petty. Two empires fought over two people who just wanted to be left alone.\n\n### The Mountain Splits\n\nIn her rage at the senseless death, Vera's power manifested fully.\n\n**She split the mountain.**\n\nRaw magical force, grief and anger made manifest, tore the rock apart. The pass that had been collapsing became a canyon—controlled, deliberate, carved by will alone.\n\nAnd in that canyon, 500 feet above the ground, she carved a city.\n\n### Veraheim Born\n\n\"Vera's Home.\" A sanctuary accessible only by lifts she controlled. A dragon on the peak. A trade route through the tunnel below—the only safe passage between east and west.\n\nBoth empires could threaten. Neither could attack. The dragon alone made assault suicide. Vera's demonstrated power made it worse.\n\nThey came to negotiate. They stayed to trade. They've been paying tolls ever since.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Truth About Thaelen's Mission\n\nThaelen wasn't just sent to \"investigate.\" Velindor Shadowmere had identified Vera as a potential threat—a human with power approaching elven archmages, loyal to no one, impossible to control.\n\n**The secret order:** If opportunity arose, eliminate her. Make it look like the disaster killed her. Report back that she died heroically.\n\n**What Thaelen did:** He burned the orders. He never told Vera. He's never told anyone. Velindor suspects but has no proof.\n\n### What Vera Killed\n\nWhen she split the mountain, she wasn't just shaping rock. Imperial soldiers and Kingdom knights were in the pass, trying to capture them.\n\n**The death toll:** Unknown. Vera doesn't know exactly. Thaelen does—he counted the bodies. Dozens. Maybe more.\n\n**The cover-up:** No one talks about it. The official history is that she \"created\" Veraheim, not that she killed people doing it. Both empires buried the truth because admitting their soldiers died to a single sorceress was humiliating.\n\n**Vera's guilt:** She knows she killed people. She tells herself it was self-defense. She tells herself they would have killed her and Thaelen. She tells herself there was no choice. She's not sure she believes it.\n\n### Thorongil's Choice\n\nWhen Thaelen fell in love with a human, Thorongil had to choose: his bond or his species.\n\n**He chose his bond.** Without hesitation.\n\n**Why:** Dragons bond for life. The relationship between rider and dragon is deeper than species loyalty. When Thaelen chose Vera, Thorongil chose her too—not as a second bond, but as pack. Family. His.\n\n**The consequence:** He can never return to dragon society. The elders consider him a traitor twice over—once for siding with elves in the war, once for helping his rider defect. He doesn't care. His family is on the mountain.\n\n### The Lift Vulnerability\n\nThe lifts are powered by Vera's magic, tied to her life force. If she dies, they stop working within hours.\n\n**Who knows:**\n- Thaelen (terrified of it)\n- Vera (won't discuss it)\n- Velindor Shadowmere (has agents investigating)\n\n**The problem:** Vera is human. She'll die eventually—of age if nothing else. When she does, 3,500 people are trapped 500 feet in the air with no way down.\n\n**The solution:** None. They've tried to create backup systems. Nothing works. The magic is uniquely hers.\n\n### Why the Empires Don't Attack\n\n**The official reasons:**\n- The dragon\n- Vera's power\n- Economic necessity\n\n**The deeper reasons:**\n- Fear of what Vera might do if cornered\n- Uncertainty about what other powers she has\n- The example she set—she killed soldiers by splitting a mountain\n- Neither empire wants to be the one that triggers her full rage\n\n### The Real Reason Thaelen Defected\n\nIt wasn't just love. Thaelen discovered the truth about the Dragon War—that elves struck first against the drow, that the genocide was built on lies.\n\n**His choice:** Stay in an empire built on hidden crimes, or leave with the woman he loved. Love made it easy. The truth made it necessary.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Death Count** | Someone has a list of everyone Vera killed when she split the mountain.
