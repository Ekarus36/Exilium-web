  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nStocky, prosperous build. Thinning brown hair, neat beard. Calculating blue eyes. Dresses expensively—quality signals wealth. Ink-stained fingers from handling his own accounts. Comfortable rather than imposing. Speaks in terms of value, cost, and investment.\n\n### Personality\nBusiness-minded above all. Sees everything as transaction. Pragmatic, not ideological. Values predictability and contracts. Will work with anyone profitable. Not driven by ego, which makes him reliable in his own way.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Isabeau (née Rotfels, 45) - Lord Rotfels's sister. Homesick for the coast, quietly miserable.\n- **Heir:** Reynard (24) - Lazy wastrel, spends money freely, no head for business. Father's despair.\n- **Second Son:** Gaston (21) - Financial genius, utterly uncharismatic. Should inherit but won't.\n- **Sister:** Cordelia (42) - Married to Lord Godfrey Ravenscar, connecting trade and tradition.\n- **Daughter:** Margaux (18) - Playing the marriage market carefully.\n\n### Domain & Wealth\nRules ~16,000 people in the river valleys. Controls major river crossings—everyone pays tolls. Runs banking services (smaller than Belmont). Commands 1,200 adequate soldiers and 100 river patrol boats.\n\n### Political Position\nTrade partner with Belmont. Connected to Ravenscar through sister Cordelia, and to Thornwood through Lady Marian (Alaric's wife is Bertrand's sister). Stays out of political conflicts—bad for business.\n\n---",
