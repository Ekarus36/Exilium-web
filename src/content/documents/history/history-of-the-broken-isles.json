  "commonKnowledge": "### The First Peoples (Ancient)\n\nBefore outsiders arrived, the islands were already inhabited:\n- **Orcs** on Stormcrag (farming, raiding, clan feuds)\n- **Goblins** on Greenfire Isle (early shipbuilding)\n- **Bugbears** in Mistwood (hunting, ruins)\n\nWhere they came from is lost to time. They simply were.\n\n### The Refugee Era (~200-120 years ago)\n\nAs mainland persecution intensified, desperate people fled to the Isles:\n- Kingdom commoners fleeing noble rule\n- Drow escaping the genocide\n- Half-breeds rejected by both societies\n- Criminals, deserters, the desperate\n\nIntegration was rough. The First Peoples didn't welcome invaders. But shared enemies—the mainland powers—eventually created common ground.\n\n### The Scattering (~120-118 years ago)\n\nFor decades, the Isles had no unity:\n- Pirates preyed on each other\n- No safe harbors\n- Mainland powers picked off ships one by one\n- Every captain for themselves\n\n### The Empire's Wrath (~118 years ago)\n\nThe Thelassian decided to end the drow escape route permanently. Emperor Valandor authorized a purge fleet: 40+ warships, thousands of soldiers, orders to show no mercy.\n\nWord reached the Isles. Panic spread. Individual captains couldn't fight a fleet.\n\n### The Storm Rises\n\n[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) had sailed these waters for 180 years, destroying Empire ships but ignoring Isles politics. This time was different. The Empire was coming for drow—for his people.\n\nHe sailed into Freehold Harbor and called every captain to gather:\n\n> *\"The Empire comes to finish what they started. We fight, or we die—not today, but soon, one by one. I will fight. Those who sail with me will have the protection of The Storm.\"*\n\nEvery captain chose to fight.\n\n### The Battle of the Broken Straits\n\n~100 pirate vessels against 40 Imperial warships. Vaelith used local knowledge to force the Empire into narrow channels where numbers meant nothing.\n\n**Result:** 30+ Imperial ships destroyed. The survivors fled. The drow they came to hunt watched their hunters drown.\n\n### The Founding\n\nAfter the battle, captains begged Vaelith to rule. He refused:\n\n> *\"Choose your own king. Make your own laws. I will be here if the Empire returns.\"*\n\nThe first Moot established:\n- The Pirate Monarch (elected)\n- Harbor Peace (Vaelith's demand)\n- Tribute system for collective defense\n- Freehold as capital\n\n### Since Then\n\n**~60 years ago:** Saltmere founded as commercial capital\n**~20 years ago:** Gorrath unites orc clans\n**~3 years ago:** Graza Bloodtide becomes Queen\n\nThe Confederation has endured 118 years. Monarchs rise and fall. The Storm remains.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### Why Vaelith Refused the Crown\n\nThe official story: He wanted the sea, not power.\n\n**The deeper truth:** Vaelith saw what crowns did. The Empire's emperor has ruled for 1,500 years, and look what the Empire became. The Kingdom's king barely controls his lords. Power corrupts. Thrones demand compromise.\n\nBy refusing to rule, Vaelith kept himself pure. He answers to no one. He compromises nothing. He can destroy the Empire with single-minded focus.\n\n**The strategic genius:** By refusing power, he gained more than any crown could give. Everyone owes him. No one can challenge him. He rules by not ruling.\n\n### The Lost First Monarch\n\nThe name of the first Pirate King is genuinely lost. Some say it was deliberate—Vaelith ordered the name forgotten so no dynasty could claim descent.\n\nOthers say the first monarch was... unremarkable. Chosen to fill a role, not for greatness. The Confederation needed a figurehead. They got one. He died. No one remembered.\n\n### What Vaelith Did Before\n\n180 years between his escape and the Battle. What did he do?\n\n**The truth:** He hunted. Every Empire ship that strayed too far east. Every slaver. Every naval patrol. He learned the waters. He built his fleet one captured ship at a time. He became a legend before he ever appeared at Freehold.\n\n**His kill count:** Unknown, but estimates range in the hundreds of ships over those decades. The Empire knows. They don't talk about it.\n\n### The Saltmere Conspiracy\n\nThe official history says three merchants founded Saltmere together.\n\n**The truth:** Vaelith suggested it. Not directly—through intermediaries. He saw the Confederation needed economic stability to survive. He nudged the right people toward the right opportunity. The founders think it was their idea.\n\nIt was his.\n\n### The Empire's Silence\n\nWhy hasn't the Empire tried again in 118 years?\n\n**What most believe:** Fear of The Storm.\n\n**What Vaelith suspects:** The Empire is waiting. Building strength. Planning. The next attack will be overwhelming—or not come at all. Valandor is patient. 118 years is nothing to an immortal.\n\n**The truth Vaelith doesn't know:** Valandor has considered it many times. Each time, his advisors talk him out of it. The risk is too high. The cost too great. And somewhere in his ancient heart, Valandor wonders if the drow haven't suffered enough.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The First Monarch's Name** | Someone claims to have found records of the first Pirate King. What does the name reveal? Why was it hidden? |\n| **The Storm's Log** | Vaelith kept records during those 180 years alone. His early logbooks still exist. What's in them? |\n| **The Saltmere Papers** | Evidence emerges that Vaelith orchestrated Saltmere's founding. Does this change anything? |\n| **The Empire Returns** | After 118 years, the Empire is building a new fleet. Is this the final confrontation? |\n| **Before the Battle** | Flashback adventure: the desperate days before the Storm rose. What were the PCs' ancestors doing? |\n\n### The Real Foundation\n\nThe Confederation exists because of fear. Not fear of enemies—fear of Vaelith.\n\nEvery monarch knows: rule poorly, and The Storm might care. Every captain knows: break Harbor Peace, and The Storm will respond. Every settlement knows: threaten the Confederation, and The Storm is the Confederation's response.\n\nHe doesn't need to act. The possibility of action is enough.\n\n**This is why the Isles work:** Not because the system is good, but because everyone fears what happens if it fails.\n\n---",
