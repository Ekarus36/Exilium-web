His blades are sought across Exilium, and his opinion on craftsmanship carries weight far beyond metal.\n\nHe's also one of Vera's advisors, representing the working class perspective that balances the founders' idealism.\n\n*Common saying: \"Get a Borin blade and you'll never need another.\"*\n\n---",

  "secretKnowledge": "### His History\n\n**Before Veraheim:**\n- Trained in traditional dwarven holds (unnamed mountains)\n- Master smith by 80, running his own forge by 100\n- Left after clan politics became intolerable\n- \"They cared more about who made a blade than if it was good.\"\n\n**Arriving in Veraheim:**\n- Came 60 years ago, before the city was fully established\n- Helped build the infrastructure (his ironwork is in the lifts)\n- Earned citizenship through exceptional craft\n- Never looked back\n\n### His Philosophy\n\n**Craft as Morality:**\n\nBorin genuinely believes quality work is a form of ethics:\n- \"A thing made well serves its purpose without deception.\"\n- \"Shoddy work is a lie about what you're capable of.\"\n- \"The forge doesn't care about your excuses.\"\n\n**On Veraheim:**\n- \"This city works because it judges results, not pedigrees.\"\n- \"I've seen orc apprentices outwork dwarf masters here. Good.\"\n- \"Vera built a place where the work matters. That's rare.\"\n\n### His Role as Advisor\n\n**What Vera values:**\n\nBorin represents the working majority:\n- Craftsmen, laborers, those who build the city daily\n- Practical perspective on policies\n- \"Will this actually work?\" rather than \"Should this work?\"\n\n**Their dynamic:**\n- Vera proposes ideas; Borin asks how they'd affect the shops\n- He doesn't defer to her status—she respects that\n- He once told her a policy was \"noble but stupid.\" She changed it.\n\n**His limits:**\n- Won't discuss things outside his knowledge\n- \"I don't know politics. I know metal.\"\n- Provides perspective, not solutions\n\n### What He Sees\n\n**The cracks in Veraheim:**\n- Apprentices struggling with housing costs\n- The contribution system favoring established crafters\n- Young people working themselves sick to prove worth\n- The pressure of the 5-year challenges\n\n**What he's told Vera:**\n- \"The system rewards excellence. It also punishes learning.\"\n- \"A young smith needs failures. Failing here means losing everything.\"\n- He's proposed a \"journeyman tier\" for those still developing\n- Vera's considering it\n\n### His Relationships\n\n**With apprentices:**\n- Treats them as future masters, not servants\n- Has launched more successful smiths than anyone\n- Stays in touch with former apprentices across Exilium\n\n**With customers:**\n- Nobles from both powers order from him (anonymously)\n- He knows his blades end up in Empire and Kingdom\n- \"Metal doesn't know politics. Neither do I.\"\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Commission** | Someone wants a blade made from unusual material (dragon scale? Cursed ore?). Borin's curious. |\n| **The Fraud** | Fake \"Ironfoot blades\" are appearing. Someone's ruining his reputation. |\n| **The Apprentice** | A troubled youth shows remarkable talent. Can Borin reach them? |\n| **The Past** | Someone from his old clan arrives. They want something—or someone. |\n| **The Masterwork** | Borin wants to make one perfect blade before he dies. He needs rare ingredients. |\n\n---",
