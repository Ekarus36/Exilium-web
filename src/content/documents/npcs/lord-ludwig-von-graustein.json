  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nAged, shrinking, still tries to stand tall. White hair, rheumy grey eyes. Trembling hands he tries to hide. Dresses in outdated finery. Looks like a man fighting time and losing. Speaks of past glories that fewer remember each year.\n\n### Personality\nStubborn to the point of self-destruction. Refuses to accept family's decline. Lives in the past. Cruel to his sons (blames them for everything). Proud beyond reason. Will die before admitting failure.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Margrit (deceased 10 years) - Her death accelerated the decline.\n- **Heir:** Aldric (38) - Believes he's owed the lordship. Bitter, scheming, would sell the domain to fund his lifestyle.\n- **Second Son:** Berthold (35) - Actually competent. Works in the mines himself. Father dismisses him.\n- **Sisters:** Vivienne (52, married to Lord Belmont), Helene (47, married to Lord Rotfels).\n\n### Domain & Decline\nRules ~8,000 people (emigrating to better domains). Eastern highlands with exhausted silver mines. Commands 1,000 poorly equipped, demoralized soldiers. Owes Belmont enormous debt. Domain is visibly collapsing.\n\n### Political Position\nToo weak to matter, too proud to ask for help. Other Lords watch the succession with interest—or predatory intent. King prefers stability but won't intervene.\n\n---",
