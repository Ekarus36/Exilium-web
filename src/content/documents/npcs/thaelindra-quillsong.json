  "rawContent": "# Thaelindra Quillsong\n\n**Imperial Chronicler** | Silvered Tower (Court Position)\n\n> *\"History is written by the victors. I write it for everyone else.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 320 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Female |\n| **Role** | Records Court Proceedings |\n| **Reports To** | First Remembrancer Thaelorin |\n| **Location** | Throne Hall and Silvered Tower |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThaelindra Quillsong records everything that happens in the Throne Hall—every petition, every ruling, every word the Emperor speaks in official capacity. Her transcripts become official history. She is present at every formal audience, writing constantly, noticed by no one until her records are needed.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nObservant, quiet, professionally invisible. Has perfected the art of being present without being seen. Writes in a shorthand only she can fully decode, then transcribes into official record. Remembers conversations from decades ago—her notes are that thorough.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Has recorded court proceedings for 250 years\n- Her transcripts are the official record of Imperial history\n- Present at every formal audience without exception\n- Can quote exchanges from decades past\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nShe keeps a second, private journal—recording what she observes but doesn't transcribe: the Emperor's fatigue, the Pillars' unspoken tensions, the lies she's not supposed to notice. If this journal surfaced, it would embarrass half the court.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Thaelorin**: Superior - Her records feed his archives\n- **Caladir Inkwell**: Colleague - He files what she produces\n- **Everyone at court**: Observer - She sees everything, says nothing\n",
