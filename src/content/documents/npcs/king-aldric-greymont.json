  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nTall but not imposing, lean build going soft with age. Grey-streaked brown hair kept short and neat. Tired grey eyes that miss nothing. Well-groomed beard, silver at the edges. Dresses richly but practically—a king who works. Speaks carefully, weighs every word, rarely shows emotion in public.\n\n### Personality\nPatient, calculating, never acts in anger. Genuinely values stability over glory. Has a dry wit he rarely shows publicly. Treats his Lords like chess pieces—respects their uses, doesn't trust their motives. Exhausted by the constant management of noble egos but hides it well.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Queen Margarethe (née Ravenscar, 49) - Political partnership and genuine affection. Runs her own spy network.\n- **Heir:** Crown Prince Roderick (28) - Martial, aggressive, impatient. Father and son clash constantly over policy.\n- **Daughters:** Eleanora (25, married to Königsford heir), Catarina (22, scholar, unmarried), Isabelle (19, newly on marriage market)\n- **Second Son:** Prince Aldwin (20) - The spare, intelligent but bitter about his uncertain role.\n\n### The Royal Court\nCommands 10,000 professional soldiers (Royal Army). Controls gold mines providing ~40% of crown income, plus 20% tax from all Lords. Maintains careful balance—no Lord too strong, no alliance too stable. Key supporters are Ravenscar (Queen's family) and Königsford (proximity).\n\n### Current Situation\nManaging the usual chaos: Ashfeld's Veraheim obsession, Wolfstein's border aggression, Blackthorne's scheming, Graustein's succession crisis. Growing concerned about Roderick's friendship with Lord Eisenwald and Lord Blackthorne. Trying to find suitable marriages for his remaining children without starting a war.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nAldric is genuinely good at his job and genuinely tired of it. He took the throne at 34 and has spent 18 years preventing civil war through careful manipulation. He's not cruel, but he is utterly pragmatic—he'll sacrifice individuals for stability without hesitation. He loves his family but sees them partly as political assets.\n\n### Hidden Fears\n- **Roderick:** His greatest fear. The Crown Prince is brave, aggressive, and stupid about politics. Roderick wants to attack Veraheim for glory. Aldric knows this would unite the elves and pirates against them and possibly end the Kingdom. He can't make Roderick understand.\n- **His own mortality:** He's 52 and feeling it. If he dies before Roderick matures, everything he's built could collapse.\n- **Lord Blackthorne:** Aldric knows Edmund is dangerous but can't prove anything. He suspects the murders but lacks evidence.\n\n### The Queen's Network\nMargarethe runs the Kingdom's intelligence operations. Aldric knows and approves, though he doesn't know every detail. Her spy network extends into every Lord's household. She's more ruthless than he is—she's had people killed to protect the family. Aldric suspects but doesn't ask.\n\n### Political Manipulation\nAldric deliberately keeps the Lords divided:\n- Encourages Ravenscar-Königsford rivalry for his favor\n- Uses Ashfeld's Veraheim obsession to distract from real issues\n- Allows Belmont's debt schemes because they create useful leverage\n- Keeps Eisenwald busy with promises of future campaigns that never happen\n\n### The Succession Problem\nAldric is privately trying to delay Roderick's marriage because he fears any alliance will embolden his son. The Eisenwald and Blackthorne factions both want Roderick—Aldric is blocking both while appearing to consider all options.\n\n### What He Actually Wants\n- To live long enough for Roderick to mature (unlikely)\n- To find a wife for Roderick who will moderate him (searching)\n- To neutralize Blackthorne without starting a war (no clear path)\n- To die knowing the Kingdom will survive him (uncertain)\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The King's Mission** | Aldric needs something done quietly. He hires adventurers because Lords can't be trusted. |\n| **Succession Crisis** | Aldric falls ill. Roderick and various Lords begin positioning. The PCs must navigate the chaos. |\n| **The Evidence** | Proof of Blackthorne's crimes exists. Aldric wants it—but using it could trigger civil war. |\n| **The Marriage Game** | One of the princesses' marriages becomes a flashpoint. PCs are caught in the political storm. |\n| **Father and Son** | Roderick plans something reckless. Does the party help the King stop him, or help Roderick succeed? |\n\n---",
