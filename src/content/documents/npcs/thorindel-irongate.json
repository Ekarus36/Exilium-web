  "rawContent": "# Thorindel Irongate\n\n**Gate Warden** | Eternal Guard\n\n> *\"This gate has stood for 1,500 years. It has never been breached. It will not be breached today.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 450 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Male |\n| **Role** | Crown Plaza Access Control |\n| **Reports To** | Captain Thandril Ironsong |\n| **Location** | Gates of the Crown |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThorindel Irongate controls access to the Crown—every elf, human, dwarf, or other being who wishes to enter must pass his inspection. He commands the gate guards, maintains the access lists, and makes the final decision on who enters and who doesn't. He is the first and last barrier.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nSuspicious, thorough, immune to pressure. Treats every visitor as a potential threat until proven otherwise. Nobles resent his questioning; he doesn't care. Has turned away Great House members for insufficient documentation. His job is security, not courtesy.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Has controlled Crown access for 250 years\n- Maintains detailed records of every entry and exit\n- Can refuse anyone below Pillar rank (and delays even them)\n- Has never been bribed, threatened, or persuaded\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nHe keeps a personal list of people he's refused entry who later proved to be threats—vindication of his suspicion. He also keeps a list of people he admitted who turned out to be problems. The second list is longer. It keeps him paranoid. Good.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Thandril Ironsong**: Commander - Final authority on access disputes\n- **All visitors**: Professional adversary - Everyone passes through his gate\n- **Velindor Shadowmere**: Uneasy - The spymaster's agents sometimes bypass gates\n",
