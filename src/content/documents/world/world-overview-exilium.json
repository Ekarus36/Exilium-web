  "rawContent": "# World Overview - Exilium\n\n**Setting Name**: Exilium  \n**System**: D&D 5e 2024 Rules  \n**Lore Status**: Custom - does not follow standard D&D lore  \n**Key Theme**: Exile, sanctuary, and the price of idealism in a world of prejudice\n\n---\n\n## The Name\n\n**Exilium** - A world defined by those it casts out. The name reflects:\n- The exile of those rejected by the major powers\n- The self-imposed exile of Vera and Thaelen\n- The sanctuary (asylum) they created for the exiled\n- A world where not fitting in means leaving, hiding, or dying\n\n---\n\n## The Two Great Powers\n\n### [Thelassian](/factions/thelassian) (West)\n\n**Capital**: [Aelindor](/geography/aelindor-the-eternal-city) (14 days west of Veraheim)  \n**Ruler**: Emperor [Valandor Aethril](/npcs/emperor-valandor-aethril) (1,500+ years on throne)  \n**Government**: Absolute monarchy with [Four Pillars](/factions/thelassian#The Four Pillars) administration  \n**Population**: ~150,000 elves across 10 enclaves  \n**Territory**: Western lands, including the northwestern dragon mountains\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Ancient, stable, controlled\n- Elven supremacy ideology\n- Strategic military (quality over quantity)\n- No death penalty for elves\n- Achievement-based justice system\n- Second-class status for non-elves\n- **Kill-on-sight policy for all drow** (400 years running)\n\n**The Ten Enclaves**: [The Elven Enclaves](/geography/the-elven-enclaves)\n- Aelindor (capital, 50,000)\n- Vaeltharis, Serath Vorn, Caelindra, Thalwei, Lithvaen\n- Naerith, Velindor, Raemond, Saelthorn\n\n---\n\n### [Aloria](/factions/aloria) (East)\n\n**Capital**: <span class=\"broken-link\" title=\"Page not found: Thornreich\">Thornreich</span> (14 days east of Veraheim)  \n**Ruler**: King [Aldric Greymont](/npcs/king-aldric-greymont) \"The Diplomat King\"  \n**Heir**: Prince Roderick Greymont (28)  \n**Government**: Feudal monarchy with 11 powerful Lords  \n**Structure**: Nearly autonomous domains, constant political intrigue  \n**Territory**: Eastern lands beyond the Shieldwall mountains\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Fractious, politically unstable\n- Human supremacy ideology\n- Feudal system (nobles vs peasants)\n- Aggressive military (quantity over quality)\n- Lords scheme constantly, alliances shift\n- Non-humans treated like 1930s Jim Crow America\n- King barely maintains control through gold mines and standing army\n\n**The Eleven Domains**: [The Eleven Domains](/factions/the-eleven-domains)\n- Each Lord rules nearly autonomously\n- Compete for land, favor, and power\n- Royal succession: eldest son inherits\n- Daughters married for political alliances\n\n---\n\n## The Sanctuary: Veraheim\n\n### [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) - The Safe Haven\n\n**Founded**: 80 years ago by [Vera Wyrdweaver](/npcs/vera-wyrdweaver) (human sorcerer) and [Thaelen Ruincalen](/npcs/thaelen-ruincalen) (elven dragon rider)  \n**Location**: Central mountain pass, 500 feet above ground  \n**Population**: 3,500 permanent residents + temporary visitors  \n**Access**: Three magical lifts (only way up/down)  \n**Guardian**: [Thorongil (Vaethor)](/npcs/thorongil-vaethor) the dragon, perched on natural peak above city\n\n**Core Principles**:\n- All races treated equally\n- Citizenship through contribution (merit-based)\n- No private property - housing awarded by tier\n- Retirement benefits for lifetime contributors\n- **No place for the useless** - must contribute or leave\n\n**Structure**: [Veraheim - City Layout](/geography/veraheim-city-layout-structure)\n- Level 1: Lower Plaza (harbor level, mid-tier housing)\n- Level 2: Crafter's District (employee housing, workshops)\n- Level 3: Grand Castle (high officials, Vera & Thaelen)\n\n**Economy**:\n- Tunnel toll revenue (only safe east-west passage)\n- **Master craftsmanship** (best goods in the realm)\n- Diversity + competition = superior products\n- Premium prices for \"Made in Veraheim\"\n\n**Demographics**: [Veraheim - Demographics](/geography/veraheim-demographics-racial-composition)\n- 13 races represented\n- Drow (15%), Humans (25%), Dwarves (12%), Half-Elves (10%)\n- Most persecuted races have largest populations\n- Inverts outside power structures\n\n**Defense**:\n- 300 guards commanded by Thaelen\n- Three lifts (can be disabled instantly)\n- 500ft cliffs (unclimbable)\n- Thorongil the dragon (ultimate deterrent)\n\n---\n\n### [The Floating Docks](/geography/the-floating-docks) - The Dark Mirror\n\n**Location**: Open water off Veraheim's harbor  \n**Population**: ~500-800 desperate people  \n**Status**: Lawless, no official recognition\n\n**The Rule**: \"Off by Sunset\"\n- Can visit Veraheim during day\n- Must leave by sunset if no contribution status\n- Those too poor or unqualified end up here\n\n**Structure**:\n- Independent \"floats\" (clusters of boats lashed together)\n- Tavern floats (The Rusty Anchor, Mama Kresh's, The Siren's Call)\n- Community floats (Drow Haven, Halfling families, human refugees)\n- Gang floats (Tide Reapers, Barnacles, The Drowned)\n- Service floats (boat repair, water, supplies)\n\n**The Reality**:\n- Extreme poverty and violence\n- Three criminal gangs prey on residents\n- Children drowning, disease spreading\n- Vera & Thaelen don't intervene (resource limits, jurisdiction, no solution)\n- **The price of Veraheim's idealism** - those who fall through cracks\n\n---\n\n## Major Themes\n\n### Merit vs Birth\n- **Veraheim**: Contribution and merit determine worth\n- **Empire & Kingdom**: Race and bloodline determine worth\n- **Question**: Can idealism survive in a hostile world?\n\n### Racism & Persecution\n- Both powers enforce racial hierarchies\n- [Drow Persecution](/peoples/drow-persecution): 400-year genocide by elves\n- Aloria: Jim Crow-style oppression\n- Veraheim proves integration works (but at a cost)\n\n### The Cost of Idealism\n- Veraheim is sanctuary... for 3,500 people\n- What about the 501st person?\n- [The Floating Docks](/geography/the-floating-docks) shows the limits\n- Can't save everyone - who decides who deserves saving?\n\n### Forbidden Love\n- [Vera Wyrdweaver](/npcs/vera-wyrdweaver) and [Thaelen Ruincalen](/npcs/thaelen-ruincalen)\n- Human sorcerer + Elven dragon rider\n- Created sanctuary rather than choose sides\n- Both powers view them as traitors/criminals\n- Love across boundaries as revolutionary act\n\n---\n\n## The World's Magic\n\n### [Magic Items System](/world/magic-items-in-exilium)\n\n**Core Rule**: Magic items are NOT crafted - they are **earned through heroic deeds**\n\n**How It Works**:\n1. Start with quality mundane item (Veraheim makes the best)\n2. Wield it in heroic circumstances\n3. Item gains power related to the deed\n4. Enhancement is permanent\n\n**Examples**:\n- Fight outnumbered and win → +1 weapon\n- Slay a dragon → Dragon Bane\n- Survive volcano → Fire Resistance\n\n**Implications**:\n- Can't buy power, must earn it\n- Each magic item has a story\n- Veraheim's crafts are essential (best foundation)\n- Power = merit, not wealth\n\n---\n\n### [Religion System](/world/religion-in-exilium-the-one-god-many-names)\n\n**The Truth**: Only ONE God exists (mortals don't know this)\n\n**The Belief**: Each race has their own god(s)\n- Humans: Solmaren the Golden Father (sun, kingship, dominion)\n- Elves: Vaelithar the Eternal Light (starlight, destiny, wisdom)\n- Drow: Velandra the Hidden Flame (survival, protection in darkness)\n- Orcs: Gruumok the Thunderer (strength, storms, honor)\n- Dwarves: Thromdur the Deep Fire (craft, stone, clan)\n- Halflings: Aelwyn the Gentle Hand (home, family, comfort)\n- Gnomes: Garl Glittergold (curiosity, invention, joy)\n\n**How Clerics Work**:\n- Power through faith, not direct divine contact\n- Domains are disciplines, not different deities\n- God answers sincere prayers regardless of name used\n- All prayers reach the same source\n\n**The Irony**: Each culture uses religion to justify supremacy, but all worship the same God who doesn't care about race.\n\n---\n\n## Geography\n\n### [Geography and Distances](/world/exilium-world-geography)\n\n**The Shieldwall** (Central Mountains):\n- Runs north-south, dividing the continent\n- [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary) sits in the central pass\n\n**Northwestern Mountains** (Dragon Territory):\n- Home to dragons for millennia\n- Dragons retreated here 400 years ago after [The Elves-Dragon War](/history/the-elves-dragon-war)\n- No contact with elves since\n\n**Distances**:\n- Veraheim ↔ Aelindor: 14 days walking\n- Veraheim ↔ Thornreich: 14 days walking\n- Through tunnel: 1 full day\n- Total (capital to capital): 25 days walking\n- Veraheim is perfectly equidistant = symbolic neutrality\n\n---\n\n## History\n\n### [Timeline -

must earn your place\n\n---\n\n## The Questions That Define Exilium\n\n**Can idealism survive reality?**\n- Veraheim proves integration works\n- But can only support 3,500 people\n- The Floating Docks shows the cost\n\n**Is merit enough?**\n- Veraheim judges by contribution\n- But what about those who can't contribute?\n- Is it fair to demand productivity for survival?\n\n**Can wounds heal?**\n- 400 years of drow genocide\n- Centuries of elf-human hostility\n- Lost dragon bonds\n- Is reconciliation possible?\n\n**What is home?**\n- Exile from homeland\n- Sanctuary in foreign city\n- Belonging through contribution, not birth\n- Where do the unwanted belong?\n\n---\n\n## For Game Masters\n\n### What Makes Exilium Unique\n\n**Not Standard Fantasy**:\n- Magic items earned, not bought\n- One God, multiple interpretations\n- Racism as central theme (uncomfortable but important)\n- Idealism vs pragmatism as constant tension\n- No clear \"good guys\" - everyone has blood on their hands\n\n**Moral Complexity**:\n- Vera & Thaelen are heroes... who let people suffer on the Floats\n- Valandor rules well... but commits genocide\n- The Lords scheme... but the Kingdom needs stability\n- Good intentions aren't enough\n\n**Player Opportunities**:\n- Fight racism and persecution\n- Navigate political intrigue\n- Earn legendary magic items through heroism\n- Build reputation in Veraheim\n- Expose corruption\n- Help the Floating Docks\n- Question the systems\n\n---\n\n## Campaign Starting Points\n\n### Starting in Veraheim\n- New arrivals trying to prove contribution\n- Day workers living on Floating Docks\n- Established residents with contribution status\n- Guards serving under Thaelen\n\n### Starting Elsewhere\n- Refugees fleeing persecution (drow, half-breeds, etc.)\n- Agents of Empire or Kingdom (spies, diplomats)\n- Adventurers seeking Veraheim's master craftsmen\n- Merchants using the tunnel trade route\n\n### Major Plot Hooks\n- Gang violence on Floating Docks\n- Lord schemes to conquer Veraheim\n- Drow seeking to end genocide\n- Mystery of the dragon bonds\n- Political intrigue in Empire or Kingdom\n- Reform movements in either power\n- Discovery that all gods are one\n\n---\n\n## The Heart of Exilium\n\nExilium asks: **What happens to those who don't fit?**\n\nIn most worlds, they disappear into footnotes. In Exilium, they built **Veraheim** - a city that proves another way is possible. But even Veraheim has limits, and those limits have names, faces, and stories.\n\nThe Floating Docks drift in the shadow of the city on the mountain, a reminder that idealism always has a price, and someone always pays it.\n\n**This is Exilium: A world of exile, sanctuary, and the impossible choices between them.**\n\n---\n\n*Setting Complete: 95%*  \n*Total Documentation: ~57,000+ words*  \n*Ready for Play: Yes*\n",
