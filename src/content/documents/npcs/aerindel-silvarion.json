  "rawContent": "# Aerindel Silvarion\n\n**Voice of the Throne** | Imperial Inner Circle\n\n> *\"The Emperor's words are not spoken. They are delivered.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 350 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Male |\n| **Role** | Imperial Herald & Spokesperson |\n| **Reports To** | Emperor Valandor directly |\n| **Location** | Eternal Spire |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nAerindel Silvarion speaks with the Emperor's authority. Every proclamation, summons, and official communication passes through him. He has memorized 1,500 years of protocol and has never made a procedural error. When Aerindel speaks, the Empire listens—because he speaks for Valandor.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nPrecise, formal, emotionless in public. His voice is trained to carry across the largest halls without shouting. Shows no personal opinion—he is a vessel for Imperial will. In private, exhausted by the constant performance but genuinely devoted to his role.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Has delivered every Imperial proclamation for 200 years\n- Memorized the exact phrasing of every historical decree\n- Can recite protocol for any diplomatic situation instantly\n- One of very few who speaks with the Emperor daily\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nHe's noticed Valandor's increasing isolation over the past century. The Emperor speaks less, delegates more, and seems... tired. Aerindel has told no one. He's not sure what it means.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Emperor Valandor**: Master - Speaks his words\n- **Thandril Ironsong**: Colleague - Coordinates security for announcements\n- **Isileth**: Professional - Handles diplomatic phrasing together\n",
