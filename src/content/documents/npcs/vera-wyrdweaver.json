  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nAppears early 30s despite her century of life. Dark brown to black hair, shoulder-length and slightly wild. Striking green eyes that occasionally glow when she uses magic. Average to tall height (~5'8\"), slender but not frail. Wears rich teal and emerald robes with gold embroidery. Multiple layered necklaces with magical foci. Commands attention without trying—power radiates subtly.\n\n### Personality\nWarm but decisive. Makes hard choices because someone has to. Brutally honest about limitations, including her own. Accessible to citizens—remembers names, asks about families. But firm when crossed—eyes glow green, voice goes quiet, and people obey. 80 years of leadership shows in measured confidence.\n\n### Family & Relationships\n- **Partner:** Thaelen Ruincalen - Elven co-ruler, their love story is legendary. Still deeply in love after 80 years.\n- **Thorongil:** The dragon guardian. She visits him regularly on the peak—they have long philosophical conversations.\n- **No children:** Never had any. Veraheim is her legacy.\n\n### Known Powers\nEveryone knows she's the most powerful sorceress alive:\n- Split a mountain range (the tunnel exists because of her)\n- Controls Veraheim's three magical lifts\n- Her magic powers the city's infrastructure\n- Could level armies if provoked\n\n### Public Role\n- Holds public audiences twice weekly (accessible to citizens)\n- Makes policy decisions on housing, trade, resources\n- Visible presence—walks through districts, inspects infrastructure\n- The \"face\" of Veraheim alongside Thaelen\n\n### The Floating Docks\nEveryone knows her position: Veraheim can support 3,500 people sustainably. She won't expand and risk the city. The Floats are tragic but necessary overflow. She visits sometimes but doesn't change policy.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nVera was a young idealist 80 years ago who believed love and power could change the world. Now she's an experienced leader who knows idealism has limits—but refuses to abandon it entirely. She constantly questions herself to avoid corruption. The weight of those she cannot save haunts her.\n\n### The Mountain-Splitting Cost\nThe famous feat nearly killed her:\n- Required immense effort and time to recover\n- She could do it again if absolutely necessary\n- But it would still exhaust her\n- Uses it as weapon of last resort only\n- \"I split a mountain in anger. What else might I do if I stop checking myself?\"\n\n### The Floats Guilt\nThis eats at her daily:\n- Sees the Floating Docks from her castle every single day\n- Knows children are drowning, people starving\n- Maintains the policy anyway\n- Secretly funds Mama Kresh's Haven (anonymous)\n- Ensures water barge doesn't run out (subsidized)\n\n**The Halfling Girl (Her Deepest Shame):**\nFive years ago, an 8-year-old from the Floats asked why her family couldn't live in the city. Vera explained the contribution system. The girl said her baby brother got sick, they spent everything on medicine. Vera gave them gold anonymously—enough for two months. But didn't change the policy. She told only Thorongil. This haunts her more than anything.\n\n### Preventing Corruption\nVera is deeply aware she could become a tyrant. Active safeguards:\n\n**Thorongil Conversations (3-4x weekly):**\n- Evening visits to his peak\n- Long philosophical discussions\n- He challenges her reasoning, points out blind spots\n- Her \"confession\" and \"therapy\" sessions\n\n**Trusted Moral Advisors (5 people):**\n1. **Thaelen** - Most trusted voice, 400 years of perspective\n2. **Mirelen Dawnwhisper** - Drow elder, reminds her what persecution looks like\n3. **Borin Ironfoot** - Dwarf smith, working-class perspective\n4. **Marigold Tealeaf** - Halfling grandmother FROM THE FLOATS (Vera visits \"randomly,\" Marigold doesn't know she's an advisor)\n5. **Kellan Ashvale** - Retired guard captain, practical ethics\n\n### The Succession Problem\nCritical vulnerability she hasn't solved:\n- All city magic runs on her power\n- If she dies, the lifts stop, infrastructure fails\n- No replacement trained\n- No succession plan\n- Makes her life essential to 3,500 people's survival\n\n### What She Actually Wants\n- Veraheim to survive and thrive\n- To die knowing she didn't become a tyrant\n- Peace with both powers (unlikely)\n- To save more people (can't figure out how)\n\n### What She Fears\n- Losing Thaelen (couldn't bear to continue alone)\n- Becoming what she hates (has the power to be a tyrant)\n- Veraheim failing (proving the cynics right)\n- Being right about the Floats (the pragmatism being necessary is almost worse)\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Lady's Mission** | Vera needs something done that requires deniability. She hires adventurers. |\n| **The Succession Crisis** | She's finally looking for someone to train as replacement.
