  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nTall for a hobgoblin, imposing presence. Wears a modified Empire admiral's coat with pirate additions. The genuine Empire admiral's bicorn hat is his most prized possession. Rigid posture, hands clasped behind back, chin up. Looks like a proper naval officer—if that officer had killed the previous uniform owner.\n\n### Personality\nHe thinks he's very serious. He's not. Insists on proper naval terminology, demands salutes, gives long speeches about discipline and honor, refers to piracy as \"naval operations.\" Gets genuinely offended when people laugh. But beneath the absurdity is brutal efficiency—his fleet actually works, and he's killed more people than most captains.\n\n### The Fleet\n- 15-20 ships organized into \"squadrons\"\n- Officers hold naval ranks (Commander, Lieutenant, etc.)\n- Formal hierarchy and chain of command\n- Matching uniforms (modified, pirate-style)\n- Regular drills and training exercises\n- Flagship: *Ironbound* (captured Empire warship)\n\n### Working for The Admiral\n**High Risk:** Brutal discipline. Punishments for failure include flogging, keelhauling, execution. Constant drills. No questioning orders.\n**High Reward:** Regular reliable pay. Larger shares than most crews. Successful operations. Clear advancement path.\n\n### Known Relationships\n- **Queen Graza:** Respects chain of command. Pays tribute properly. Attends every Moot in full uniform.\n- **The Storm:** Once tried to salute him. The Storm stared for ten seconds and walked away. Kozrek still doesn't know what that meant.\n- **The Rapier:** Mutual contempt. They argue at every Moot.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nThe silly exterior hides genuine military competence. Hobgoblins have natural affinity for structure, and Kozrek's \"ridiculous\" naval discipline actually makes his fleet devastatingly effective. The coordinated tactics, the training, the hierarchy—it works. Other captains mock him while their crews underperform his.\n\n### Origin of The Admiral\nTwelve years ago, Kozrek's small fleet attacked an Empire naval convoy. Among the prizes was a command ship carrying Admiral Veranthos. Kozrek personally killed the admiral. Took his coat. Took his hat. Took his title. Then restructured his entire operation around \"proper naval discipline.\"\n\n### Why It Matters to Him\n- The Empire rejected hobgoblins as \"savage\"\n- By becoming a better admiral than the Empire's, he proves them wrong\n- The performance of legitimacy matters deeply\n- The hat is symbol of victory over those who called him inferior\n- \"We are not pirates. We are privateers without a nation.\"\n\n### The Mutiny (Three Years In)\nSome crew tried to mutiny against his harsh discipline. He personally executed seventeen people in front of the assembled fleet. The executions took all day. There hasn't been a mutiny since.\n\n### Secret Ambition\nPrivately thinks he'd be a better ruler than Graza. Too smart to say it out loud. Bides his time. Builds his fleet. Waits for opportunity.\n\n### What He Wants\n- Respect as a proper military commander\n- A larger fleet, more ships, more power\n- Eventually: perhaps the throne itself\n- The Empire to know his name and fear it\n\n### What He Fears\n- Being laughed at (deeply insecure beneath the bluster)\n- The Storm (sensibly terrified)\n- His crew realizing the discipline is all he has\n- Someone taking his hat\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Real Admiral** | The Empire sends Admiral Veranthos's son to reclaim his father's hat and honor. It's personal. |\n| **The Deserter** | Someone escaped Kozrek's fleet with secrets. He wants them back. Dead or alive. |\n| **Joint Operation** | Kozrek proposes alliance with another captain. His military discipline clashes with their style. |\n| **The Promotion** | Kozrek promotes a PC sailor. The position comes with terrifying responsibilities. |\n| **The Hat** | Someone steals The Admiral's hat as a prank. His response is disproportionate and violent. |\n\n---",
