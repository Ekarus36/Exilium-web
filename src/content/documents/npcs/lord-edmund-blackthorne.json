  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nTall, lean, with a hungry look. Black hair worn long, pale complexion, dark eyes that seem to absorb light. Sharp features, rarely smiles. Always dresses in black. Moves quietly and appears suddenly—unsettling habit. Speaks softly, forcing others to lean in and listen.\n\n### Personality\nColdly intelligent and unnervingly calm. Patient when necessary, brutal when useful. Charismatic in a dark, magnetic way—people find themselves drawn to him despite their better judgment. Shows no warmth, no humor, no obvious weakness. Other Lords find him deeply unsettling.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Seraphina (née Ashfeld, 28) - Lord Ashfeld's sister. Rarely seen in public, appears fragile and withdrawn.\n- **Son:** Damien (4) - Heir. Too young to assess.\n- **Siblings:** Two older brothers and father, all deceased. Edmund was the third son who never expected to inherit.\n\n### Domain\nRules ~8,000 people across the northern moors. Primary resources are wool, peat, and stone. Not a wealthy domain, but his military has grown suspiciously fast. Maintains 2,200 soldiers—brutal, loyal, and feared. His elite \"Thornguard\" (200 men) are rumored to do terrible things.\n\n### Public Relationships\n- **Crown:** Pays taxes, follows laws, but King Aldric watches him constantly. Queen Margarethe openly despises him.\n- **Ashfeld:** Allied through marriage, though Robert Ashfeld seems uncomfortable with the arrangement.\n- **Ravenscar/Thornwood:** Openly hostile. Lord Alaric Thornwood has called him \"a stain on the nobility.\"\n- **Belmont:** Owes Charles Belmont 15,000 gold—a dangerous amount of leverage.\n\n### Current Situation\nBuilding military strength. Attends court minimally. Has been seen cultivating a friendship with Prince Roderick—drinking companions. Watching the Graustein succession crisis with obvious interest.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nEdmund is exactly as dangerous as he appears—possibly more. He murdered his way to lordship (both brothers, then his father) and feels no remorse. He views people purely as tools. His ultimate ambition is the throne itself, though he's patient enough to wait for the right moment. He genuinely enjoys fear—both causing it and seeing it in others' eyes.\n\n### The Murders\n- **Brother Aldric:** \"Hunting accident\"—trampled by horses. Corvin spooked them.\n- **Brother Gareth:** \"Sudden fever\"—poison, administered slowly over weeks.\n- **Father Oswald:** \"Broken heart\"—actually poison again, after watching both heirs die.\n- **Evidence exists:** Somewhere. A servant saw something. Finding proof could destroy Edmund.\n\n### Dark Operations\n- **Funding source:** Edmund's rapid military growth is funded by banditry. His men raid merchant convoys disguised as \"unknown brigands,\" then launder the profits.\n- **Corvin Stone (24):** Edmund's bastard half-brother, officially doesn't exist. Serves as spymaster, assassin, and enforcer. Utterly loyal—Edmund is the only one who acknowledged him. Handles the darkest work.\n- **Criminal network:** Has contacts in the underworld across multiple domains.\n\n### Seraphina's Prison\nLady Seraphina is not fragile by nature—she's been broken. Edmund is physically and emotionally abusive. She has no allies in Blackthorne Tower, and her family either doesn't know or doesn't want to know. However:\n- She's been secretly documenting evidence of Edmund's crimes\n- She knows about the murders, the banditry, Corvin's role\n- She's looking for someone to trust\n- **She could be the key to bringing Edmund down—if she survives**\n\n### Political Scheming\n- **Recruiting Marcus Ravenscar:** The ambitious second son of House Ravenscar. Edmund sees potential and is cultivating him as an agent.\n- **Aldric Graustein:** The desperate Graustein heir has promised Edmund an alliance (including the strategic eastern passes) in exchange for support.\n- **Prince Roderick:** Edmund is deliberately cultivating the heir. Not to control him, but to position himself favorably when Roderick becomes king.\n\n### What He Wants (True Goals)\n1. Absorb Graustein when it collapses (expand territory)\n2. Eliminate or neutralize Belmont debt (remove leverage)\n3. Build enough power to become kingmaker—or king\n4. Never be vulnerable again\n\n### What He Fears (Hidden)\n- Evidence of the murders surfacing\n- A coalition forming against him before he's ready\n- Seraphina escaping with what she knows\n- Dying before achieving his goals\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Prisoner's Plea** | Seraphina secretly contacts the PCs. Can they help her escape? What information does she have? |\n| **The Evidence** | Proof of Edmund's murders exists. Finding it requires infiltrating Blackthorne Tower or tracking down the surviving witness. |\n| **The Dark Alliance** | Edmund offers the PCs lucrative employment. The pay is excellent. The work is morally horrifying. |\n| **Corvin's Hunt** | The bastard assassin is hunting someone. The PCs are caught in the middle—or are the target. |\n| **The Graustein Deal** | Evidence of Aldric Graustein's treasonous promise to Edmund. Exposing it could reshape the Kingdom. |\n| **Marcus's Choice** | The Ravenscar second son is being recruited. Can the PCs intervene before he's compromised? |\n\n### If Edmund Falls\n- Seraphina would likely claim regency for young Damien\n- Corvin would either flee or die avenging his master\n- The Thornguard might fracture or become bandits\n- Graustein loses their promised ally\n- The Kingdom becomes slightly more stable—but someone else will fill the power vacuum\n\n---",
