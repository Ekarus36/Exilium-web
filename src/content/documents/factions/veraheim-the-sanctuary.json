  "commonKnowledge": "### Governance: The Founders Rule\n\n**Vera and Thaelen make all decisions.** There is no council, no parliament, no vote. This is not a democracy.\n\n**Why it works:**\n- 80 years of proven good judgment\n- Both founders are accessible, listen to concerns\n- Decisions are transparent and explained\n- The alternative (traditional government) would import factional conflict\n\n**How decisions are made:**\n- Minor issues: Handled by assigned administrators\n- Medium issues: Brought to Vera or Thaelen individually\n- Major issues: Discussed between the founders, often with Thorongil\n- City-changing decisions: Announced publicly with reasoning\n\n**Public access:** Vera holds audiences twice weekly. Anyone can bring concerns. Thaelen handles military and security matters directly with petitioners.\n\n### The Advisory Circle\n\nFive trusted individuals counsel the founders (but never vote):\n\n| Advisor | Role | Perspective |\n|---------|------|-------------|\n| **[Mirelen Dawnwhisper](/npcs/mirelen-dawnwhisper)** | Drow Elder | Persecuted peoples, survival wisdom |\n| **[Borin Ironfoot](/npcs/borin-ironfoot)** | Dwarf Smith | Working class, craftsmanship values |\n| **[Marigold Tealeaf](/npcs/marigold-tealeaf)** | Halfling Grandmother | Floating Docks reality, poverty perspective |\n| **[Kellan Ashvale](/npcs/kellan-ashvale)** | Retired Guard Captain | Security concerns, practical ethics |\n| [Thaelen Ruincalen](/npcs/thaelen-ruincalen) | Co-Founder | 400 years of experience, military insight |\n\n**Marigold is different:** She lives on the Floating Docks. Vera visits her \"randomly\" for tea, asking about life on the Floats. Marigold doesn't know she's an informal advisor—she thinks she's just chatting with a kind woman. This gives Vera unfiltered truth about those who fall through the cracks.\n\n### The Justice System\n\n**Principles:**\n- Equal treatment regardless of race\n- Focus on restitution over punishment\n- Exile as ultimate penalty\n- No death penalty (too permanent in a city of refugees)\n\n**Process:**\n1. **Accusation**: Any citizen can bring charges\n2. **Investigation**: Guards gather evidence\n3. **Hearing**: Case presented to Vera or Thaelen\n4. **Judgment**: Founders decide (can be appealed to both together)\n5. **Sentence**: Restitution, service, or exile\n\n**Common sentences:**\n- Theft: Return stolen goods + extra labor\n- Assault: Medical costs + community service\n- Fraud: Triple restitution\n- Murder: Permanent exile (dropped from the lifts with supplies)\n- Repeat offenses: Escalating penalties toward exile\n\n**The unwritten rule:** Crime against citizens of your own race is punished; crime motivated by racial hatred gets double penalties.\n\n### The Contribution Economy\n\nVeraheim doesn't use currency internally. Everything runs on **contribution status**.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. New arrivals start as day workers (can visit, can't stay overnight)\n2. Demonstrate useful skills = provisional status (6-month housing)\n3. Sustained contribution = full citizenship (permanent housing tier)\n4. Exceptional contribution = advancement (better housing, more influence)\n\n**Contribution types:**\n- **Craft**: Making goods, running shops\n- **Service**: Guards, teachers, healers, administrators\n- **Labor**: Construction, maintenance, logistics\n- **Innovation**: New techniques, solutions to problems\n\n**The 5-Year Challenges:** Every five years, craftsmen compete for the title of \"Master\" in their trade. Winners get top-tier housing and prestige. Competition drives excellence.\n\n**Retirement:** After 30+ years of contribution, citizens receive guaranteed housing and basic support regardless of continued work. \"The city remembers those who built it.\"\n\n### The Floating Docks Policy\n\nThe hardest question Veraheim faces: **what about those who can't contribute enough?**\n\n**The policy (official):**\n- Non-contributors must leave by sunset\n- The city can sustainably support ~3,500 people\n- Expansion risks collapse, helping no one\n- Harsh but necessary pragmatism\n\n**The reality:**\n- 500-800 people live on boats outside the harbor\n- Extreme poverty, gang violence, drowning children\n- Vera and Thaelen see it every day from the castle\n- They maintain the policy anyway\n\n**The compromise (unofficial):**\n- Day passes allow Floats residents to work in city\n- Water barge prices subsidized to prevent mass death\n- Vera secretly funds Mama Kresh's Haven (safe shelter)\n- Guards occasionally intervene in worst violence\n\n**Why they don't do more:**\n- Resources stretched to capacity\n- Expanding city risks infrastructure collapse\n- No magic solution (Vera's tried)\n- Intervening officially sets precedent they can't maintain\n\n**The uncomfortable truth:** The Floats are the cost of Veraheim's idealism. Someone always pays.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Succession Crisis\n\n**The critical vulnerability no one discusses:**\n\n- All city infrastructure runs on Vera's magic (lifts, defenses, power)\n- If she dies, the magic fails\n- No replacement has been trained\n- No succession plan exists\n- Vera is 100 years old—magically extended, but not immortal\n\n**Why it's not solved:**\n- Vera doesn't want to think about dying\n- No sorcerer in Veraheim approaches her power\n- Training a replacement admits mortality\n- Thaelen avoids the topic (it forces him to imagine life without her)\n\n**What would happen:**\n- Lifts would stop (city accessible only by difficult climb)\n- Defensive wards would fade\n- Economic collapse as tunnel revenue vanishes\n- Either power might attempt conquest\n- 3,500 people stranded on a mountain\n\n### The Dragon Agreement\n\n**What Thorongil receives:**\n- Hunting territory in the surrounding mountains (5-day radius)\n- Right to take livestock from both powers' herds (unofficial tribute)\n- Vera's friendship and philosophical conversation\n- Thaelen's bond—the only dragon-elf connection left\n\n**What Veraheim receives:**\n- Absolute military deterrent\n- Warning of approaching threats (dragon sight)\n- Thaelen's continued sanity (the bond sustains both)\n- Legitimacy (who attacks a dragon?)\n\n**The unspoken arrangement:** Merchants from both the Empire and Kingdom \"lose\" a percentage of livestock to \"mountain predators\" annually. Everyone knows Thorongil takes what he needs. No one objects because the alternative is the dragon hunting closer to civilization.\n\n### The Real Reason Both Powers Tolerate Veraheim\n\n**It's not just the dragon.** Veraheim serves purposes neither power admits:\n\n**For the Thelassian:**\n- Drow who might organize resistance flee there instead\n- Trade happens without Empire officials having to negotiate with \"inferior\" humans\n- Faendril secretly invests in Veraheim businesses (profits fund unauthorized projects)\n- Isileth and Vera exchange letters—back-channel diplomacy\n\n**For the Aloria:**\n- Safety valve for non-humans who might otherwise revolt\n- Lords buy Veraheim goods secretly (best quality anywhere)\n- Tunnel access prevents complete economic dependence on elves\n- Vera could return (terrifying thought, but it keeps them cautious)\n\n**The balance:** Both powers need Veraheim to exist. Neither can admit it. The tunnel generates enough profit that trade interests override military ambitions—for now.\n\n### Vera's Secret Guilt\n\nEvery few weeks, Vera walks to her window at night and looks at the Floating Docks. She counts the lights on the boats. She imagines the children sleeping on rocking floors.\n\n**The halfling girl:** Five years ago, an 8-year-old asked why her family couldn't live in the city. Her baby brother got sick; they spent everything on medicine. Vera gave them gold anonymously but didn't change the policy. She's never told anyone except Thorongil.\n\n**What she tells herself:** \"I save 3,500 people. That matters. The perfect is the enemy of the good.\"\n\n**What she fears:** Maybe she's just making excuses. Maybe there is a way to save more. Maybe she stopped looking because the answer would cost too much.\n\n### Thaelen's Hidden Pain\n\nThe stoic commander carries weights no one sees:\n\n- **He was sent to kill Vera.** Almost did it. Following orders without question. That person still lives inside him.\n- **He killed dragons.** In the Dragon War, he fought his bondmate's kin. Thorongil considers himself traitor to dragonkind because of that.\n- **He'll outlive Vera.** Elves live centuries. Humans don't. Vera's magic extends her life, but not forever. What happens after?\n\n**His coping:** Routine. Duty. Training guards. Not thinking about it. And late-night conversations with Thorongil, who understands.\n\n### Veraheim's Intelligence Network\n\n**Thaelen's guards aren't just guards.** A dozen serve as agents:\n\n- Three in the Aloria (watching Lord Ashfeld especially)\n- Two in the Thelassian (monitoring military movements)\n- One in Freehold Harbor (tracking Broken Isles threats)\n- Six rotating as travelers gathering general intelligence\n\n**What they know:**\n- Ashfeld has detailed invasion plans (delusional but detailed)\n- Empire agents operate in Veraheim (tolerated, watched)\n- Three Aloria Lords deal with pirates\n- Dragon activity in the northwestern mountains has increased recently\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Succession Test** | Vera asks PCs to help evaluate a potential successor (without telling them that's the real purpose) |\n| **The Floats Uprising** | Someone's organizing the Floating Docks. Peaceful protest—or something worse? |\n| **The Dragon's Concern** | Thorongil sensed something in the mountains. Other dragons? Something older? |\n| **The Intelligence Failure** | An agent went silent. What happened in the Aloria? |\n| **The Moral Test** | A child from the Floats needs expensive healing. Vera could save them—breaking precedent. What do PCs advise? |\n| **The Hidden Enemy** | Someone inside Veraheim is working for one of the powers. Find them without sparking paranoia |\n\n---",

Won't attack (dragon, trade losses).\n\n**Secret truth:** Faendril invests Empire gold in Veraheim businesses. Isileth exchanges letters with Vera.\n\n**Empire agents in Veraheim:** Yes, and Thaelen knows who they are. Tolerated as long as they only observe.\n\n### Aloria\n\n**Official position:** Veraheim is stolen territory and Vera betrayed her people.\n\n**Practical reality:** Multiple Lords want to attack. The King forbids it (suicide mission).\n\n**The obsession:** Lord Ashfeld has invasion plans. Prince Roderick dreams of conquest. Neither understands they'd die.\n\n**Kingdom goods in Veraheim:** Technically banned. Actually everywhere (bought through intermediaries).\n\n### Broken Isles\n\n**Official position:** None. The pirates have no unified stance.\n\n**Practical reality:** Good trade relations through Saltmere contacts.\n\n**The Storm's calculation:** Vaelith Draegor respects Veraheim. Similar philosophy (prove your worth, not your birth). He'd defend the sea approaches if asked—for a price.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Veraheim[\"🏔️ Veraheim\"]\n        Vera[\"Vera Wyrdweaver<br/>The Lady<br/>(magic, policy)\"]\n        Thaelen[\"Thaelen Ruincalen<br/>The Commander<br/>(security, military)\"]\n        Thorongil[\"Thorongil<br/>🐉 Guardian<br/>(deterrent, counsel)\"]\n    end\n\n    Vera ---|\"80 years of love\"| Thaelen\n    Vera ---|\"counsel & friendship\"| Thorongil\n    Thaelen ---|\"400-year bond\"| Thorongil\n\n    subgraph Advisors[\"👥 Advisory Circle\"]\n        Mirelen[\"Mirelen<br/>(drow perspective)\"]\n        Borin[\"Borin<br/>(working class)\"]\n        Marigold[\"Marigold<br/>(Floats reality)\"]\n        Kellan[\"Kellan<br/>(practical ethics)\"]\n    end\n\n    Vera -.->|\"consults\"| Advisors\n\n    Vera -->|\"powers\"| Infrastructure[\"City Infrastructure\"]\n    Vera -->|\"secretly funds\"| Kresh[\"Mama Kresh's Haven\"]\n\n    Floats[\"The Floating Docks<br/>500+ desperate people\"] -->|\"haunts\"| Vera\n\n    Empire[\"Thelassian\"] <-.->|\"cold tolerance\"| Veraheim\n    Kingdom[\"Aloria\"] <-.->|\"obsession\"| Veraheim\n\n    style Vera fill:#d9d2e9,color:#000\n    style Thaelen fill:#cfe2f3,color:#000\n    style Thorongil fill:#b6d7a8,color:#000\n    style Floats fill:#f4cccc,color:#000\n```\n\n---\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Vera Wyrdweaver](/npcs/vera-wyrdweaver) - The Lady, co-founder\n- [Thaelen Ruincalen](/npcs/thaelen-ruincalen) - The Commander, co-founder\n- [Thorongil (Vaethor)](/npcs/thorongil-vaethor) - The Guardian Dragon\n- [Veraheim - City Layout](/geography/veraheim-city-layout-structure) - Physical structure\n- [Veraheim - Demographics](/geography/veraheim-demographics-racial-composition) - Population breakdown\n- [The Floating Docks](/geography/the-floating-docks) - The cost of idealism\n- [Veraheim NPCs](/npcs/veraheim-npc-summary) - Other notable figures\n\n---\n\n*\"Veraheim proves that merit can triumph over birth.
