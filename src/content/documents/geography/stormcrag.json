Two orc clans—Bloodstone and Ironfang—control the island and produce the food, bonecraft, and natural-material goods the Confederation needs. They also produce warriors. Orc raiders from Stormcrag crew ships across the Isles.\n\nTwenty years ago, the clans were blood enemies. Warchief Gorrath Bloodstone forged peace through marriage alliance. Now they raid together, farm together, and stand together at The Moot.\n\n*Common saying: \"Bloodstone breaks enemies. Ironfang endures all. Together, Stormcrag feeds the fleet.\"*\n\n---",
  "commonKnowledge": "### Geography\n\nVolcanic soil makes Stormcrag the most fertile island in the Isles. Rolling hills, dense forests, rocky coastline. A central mountain ridge divides clan territories.\n\n**Key Areas:**\n- **Bloodstone Valley**: Northern farming region, Bloodstone territory\n- **Ironfang Flats**: Southern plains, Ironfang territory\n- **The Bone Coast**: Eastern shore, bonecraft workshops\n- **Ancestor's Peak**: Sacred mountain, neutral ground, clan ceremonies\n\n### The Two Clans\n\n**Bloodstone Clan** (~3,500):\n- Larger, more aggressive\n- Provides most warriors for Isles crews\n- Capital: Redhall (~1,500)\n- \"Bloodstone breaks enemies\"\n\n**Ironfang Clan** (~2,000):\n- Smaller, more patient\n- Superior farmers and craftsmen\n- Capital: Fanghold (~900)\n- \"Ironfang endures all\"\n\n**The Alliance**: Gorrath's sister married Mulga's son. Combined Clan Fleet. United at The Moot. Peace through strength.\n\n### Economy\n\n**Exports:**\n- Food (grains, vegetables, preserved meats)\n- Bonecraft (weapons, armor, tools from sea creature bones)\n- Shell goods (jewelry, decoration)\n- Warriors (orc raiders for hire)\n\n**Imports:**\n- Metal goods (from Ironhold)\n- Ships and repairs (from Skarath)\n- Luxury goods (from Saltmere)\n\n### Bonecraft\n\nOrc bonecraft is an art form. Weapons and armor made from sea creature bones—whale, shark, kraken—are lighter than metal, nearly as strong, and valued across the Isles.\n\n**Master Bonecarvers** are respected like hobgoblin smiths. A masterwork bone blade can fetch as much as Ironhold steel.\n\n### The Clan Fleet\n\nCombined naval force of both clans:\n- ~20 ships under Gorrath's command\n- Orc-crewed, orc-built (with Skarath hulls)\n- Most aggressive raiding force in the Isles\n- Gorrath leads from his flagship *Red Dawn*\n\n### Orc Culture\n\n**Ancestor Worship**: The dead guide the living. Bones of ancestors are carved into tools and weapons, keeping their spirits present. Ancestor's Peak holds clan burial grounds.\n\n**Warrior Honor**: Combat skill defines worth. Even farmers train to fight. Dying in battle is glorious; dying in bed is shameful.\n\n**Hospitality**: Once accepted as guest, you're sacred. Violating guest-right is unforgivable.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Alliance's Fragility\n\nThe peace is real but thin. Twenty years hasn't erased centuries of blood feuds.\n\n**Pressure points:**\n- Gorrath's sister (married to Ironfang) is unhappy. Her husband beats her. If she dies, the alliance might shatter.\n- Young Bloodstone warriors resent giving Ironfang \"equal\" status.\n- Some Ironfang elders think Mulga sold out clan honor.\n\n**Gorrath's fear**: He built this peace. He knows how easily it could collapse. He spends enormous energy managing tensions that most outsiders never see.\n\n### Mulga's Resentment\n\nChief Mulga Ironfang publicly supports the alliance. Privately, he hates being second to Gorrath.\n\n**His grievances:**\n- Ironfang does most of the farming; Bloodstone gets most of the glory\n- The Clan Fleet is \"joint\" but Gorrath commands it\n- At The Moot, everyone talks to Gorrath first\n\n**He's not plotting betrayal**—the alliance benefits his people. But he's bitter, and that bitterness affects every interaction.\n\n### The Kraken Cult\n\nDeep in the mountains, a small group worships something in the sea. They believe a kraken sleeps in the deep waters off Stormcrag, and that proper worship will wake it.\n\n**What they do:**\n- Secret ceremonies at sea\n- Occasional \"offerings\" (captured enemies, criminals)\n- Carve kraken imagery into hidden caves\n\n**How many:** Maybe 30-40 members across both clans. Including, troublingly, one of Gorrath's nephews.\n\n**Are they right?** Something large does live in those waters. Whether it's a god, a monster, or something else... that's for you to decide.\n\n### The Storm's Interest\n\n[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor) sees Gorrath as useful. The Clan Fleet is the Confederation's most aggressive raiding force. Gorrath is loyal to the Confederation (it benefits his people) and follows The Storm's general direction.\n\n**But**: If Gorrath ever unified ALL the orc clans (there are others on smaller islands), he'd be a real power. The Storm watches this possibility carefully. He's not threatened—yet.\n\n### The Mainland Raids\n\nGorrath's fleet raids Kingdom shipping almost exclusively. The Kingdom lords hate him specifically.\n\n**What they don't know**: Gorrath has an arrangement with Lord Blackthorne. He avoids Blackthorne's ships; Blackthorne feeds him information about rival lords' cargo.\n\n**What Gorrath doesn't know**: The Storm arranged this relationship. Blackthorne thinks he's clever; Gorrath thinks it's his own deal. The Storm controls both sides.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Sister's Bruises** | Gorrath's sister wants out of her marriage.
