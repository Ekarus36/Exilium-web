  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nStill beautiful, aging gracefully. Auburn hair now streaked with grey, worn in elaborate styles. Sharp green eyes (Ravenscar trait). Always perfectly composed, elegant bearing. Favors deep reds and royal purple. Charming in public, with a smile that never quite reaches her eyes.\n\n### Personality\nEvery bit as politically skilled as her husband, possibly more so. Charming when she wants something, ice-cold when crossed. Never forgets a slight—or a favor. Manages court social dynamics with precision. Noble ladies both admire and fear her.\n\n### Family Role\nTrue partner to Aldric, not just ornament. Advises on which Lords to trust (her answer: none). Manages her children's marriages with strategic precision. Her nephew Lord Godfrey Ravenscar is utterly loyal to the crown because of her influence.\n\n### Court Position\n- Controls social access to the royal family\n- Her favor determines who rises at court\n- Hosts events where real politics happen\n- Ladies-in-waiting report everything to her\n\n### Public Relationships\n- **Lord Ravenscar:** Nephew, completely loyal to her\n- **Lord Blackthorne:** Openly despises him (rare public emotion)\n- **Lady Seraphina Blackthorne:** Pities her, but hasn't acted\n- **Princess Eleanora:** Her eyes and ears in House Königsford\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nMargarethe is more ruthless than her husband—and he knows it. Where Aldric manipulates, Margarethe eliminates. She has ordered deaths to protect her family, arranged \"accidents\" for threats, and maintains a spy network that rivals any Lord's. She views the Kingdom as her children's inheritance and will do anything to secure it.\n\n### The Spy Network\nMargarethe runs the Kingdom's primary intelligence operation through a woman named **Serana** who officially doesn't exist:\n- Agents in every Lord's household (servants, ladies-in-waiting)\n- Network of informants in major cities\n- Occasionally employs more direct methods (poison, blackmail)\n- Aldric knows and approves, but doesn't know every detail\n\n### What She Knows\n- Blackthorne murdered his brothers and father (can't prove it)\n- Seraphina Blackthorne is being abused (monitoring the situation)\n- Lucien Belmont is planning something regarding his brother\n- Marcus Ravenscar is being recruited by Blackthorne (deeply concerning)\n- Lord Thornwood secretly helps refugees reach Veraheim (allows it—he's useful)\n\n### Hidden Agenda\nMargarethe's priorities, in order:\n1. Her children's safety and success\n2. House Greymont's continued rule\n3. The Kingdom's stability\n4. Her husband's wellbeing (genuinely loves him, but family comes first)\n\nShe would sacrifice Aldric if it meant saving her children. She would burn the Kingdom to protect them.\n\n### The Roderick Problem\nShe enables Roderick too much—she knows it. Her blind spot is her eldest son. She sees his aggression as strength, not stupidity. She's been blocking Aldric's attempts to moderate him, believing Roderick will \"grow into\" wisdom. This may doom the Kingdom.\n\n### Secret Actions\n- Had a maid executed for spying for Blackthorne (made to look like suicide)\n- Maintains files on every noble family's scandals\n- Has a standing order: if Aldric dies, Blackthorne dies within the hour\n- Quietly funding Seraphina's isolation (wants her dependent and eventually useful)\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Queen's Favor** | Margarethe wants something done that Aldric can't know about. Delicate, dangerous, well-paid. |\n| **The Network** | PCs discover Serana or the spy network. Are they recruited, silenced, or used? |\n| **Maternal Wrath** | Someone threatens one of the royal children. Margarethe's response will be disproportionate. |\n| **The Blackthorne File** | She has evidence against Edmund but can't use it. Maybe the PCs can. |\n| **Mother's Blindness** | Roderick is about to do something catastrophic. Margarethe won't stop him. Someone must. |\n\n---",
