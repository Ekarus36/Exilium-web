No exceptions. 400 years.\n\n### Achievement-Based Justice\n\nPunishment scaled to contribution:\n- High achievers (scholars, artists): Lightest sentences\n- Low achievers (laborers, young): Harsh sentences\n- Non-elves: Harshest, including execution\n- **No death penalty for elves** (centuries of wisdom too valuable)\n\n### Economy: Mutual Provision\n\nEnclaves don't pay gold taxes—they share goods. Each produces what it's suited for; Faendril's office distributes based on need.

Faendril manages this humiliation daily.\n\n### The Dragon Knights\n\nElite warrior order that once rode dragons. The Dragon War (400 years ago) severed all bonds. Now they're just elite warriors—still the best fighters in the Empire, still trained in aerial tactics, still hoping bonds might return.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Emperor's Doubt\n\nValandor has ruled for 1,500 years. He's seen everything. And lately, he's begun to wonder if the Empire can survive what's coming.\n\n**His private fears:**\n- The drow genocide created enemies who will never forgive\n- The Dragon War wasn't entirely the drow's fault (see below)\n- Thaelen's defection exposed a truth: even the best can choose exile over Empire\n- The world is changing faster than elves can adapt\n\n**What he does**: Nothing visible. He watches. He thinks. He hasn't shared these doubts with anyone—not even Isileth, whom he trusts most.\n\n### The Dragon War Truth\n\nThe official history: Drow tortured dragons, breaking sacred bonds. The Empire righteously exterminated them.\n\n**The hidden truth** (known only to Valandor, [Velindor Shadowmere](/npcs/velindor-shadowmere), and the deepest archives):\n- The war began over territory, not dragons\n- Both sides committed atrocities\n- The dragon-torture was real but was retaliation, not unprovoked\n- Elves struck first\n- The genocide was Valandor's rage, not justice\n\n**Why it matters**: If this became public, the Empire's moral foundation crumbles. 400 years of \"righteous\" killing become just... killing.\n\n### Velindor Shadowmere\n\nThe Master of Whispers knows almost everything. He's served four Emperors. He's killed for the Empire more times than he can count.\n\n**What haunts him**: He knows the Dragon War truth. He's buried evidence. He's silenced witnesses. He did it for the Empire. He'd do it again.\n\n**His network**: Agents in Veraheim (discovered and tolerated), agents in the Aloria (several lords compromised), agents in the Broken Isles (limited success). He reports only to Valandor.\n\n### The Succession Question\n\nValandor is immortal but not invulnerable. If he dies:\n- No designated heir\n- Four Pillars would struggle for control\n- Civil war possible (first in 1,500 years)\n- The Emperor refuses to discuss it\n\n**Why**: Valandor believes naming an heir would invite assassination attempts. He's probably right. But his silence creates its own danger.\n\n### Thaelen's Defection: The Real Story\n\n[Thaelen Ruincalen](/npcs/thaelen-ruincalen) didn't betray the Empire for love. He betrayed it because he discovered what the Empire did to start the Dragon War.\n\n**What Thaelen found**: Records in the Living Archive proving elves struck first against the drow. His own Dragon Knight ancestors participated in the initial attacks.\n\n**His choice**: Stay and live a lie, or leave and live with Vera. He chose Vera—and took his dragon, the last bonded dragon in the Empire.\n\n**Who knows**: Thaelen, Velindor (who tried to stop him), Valandor (who let him go rather than risk the truth spreading).\n\n### The Four Pillars' Secrets\n\n**Caerwyn**: Wants war with Veraheim. Has drawn up invasion plans. Knows they'd fail but updates them anyway. It helps him sleep.\n\n**Thaelorin**: The Living Archive contains records that would destroy the Empire. He's read them. He's sealed them. He's never told anyone what's in the deepest vaults.\n\n**Isileth**: Has been in secret contact with Vera Wyrdweaver for 60 years. They exchange letters through trusted intermediaries. They discuss philosophy, not politics. Valandor doesn't know.\n\n**Faendril**: Has secretly invested Empire gold in Veraheim-based businesses through intermediaries. The returns fund projects the other Pillars won't approve. If exposed, it would be treason.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Archive Breach** | Someone broke into the Living Archive's sealed section. What did they find? What will they do with it? |\n| **The Succession Crisis** | An assassination attempt on Valandor fails—but exposes that someone is planning for his death. Who? |\n| **Isileth's Letters** | Velindor discovers the correspondence with Vera. Does he tell the Emperor? Use it for leverage? |\n| **The Dragon Bond** | A young knight reports a dream: a dragon calling to her. Is it real? Could bonds be restored? |\n| **Drow Asylum** | A drow child arrives at Serath Vorn, alone, starving. The law says kill on sight. What does honor say? |\n| **The Truth Campaign** | Someone is spreading pamphlets about the \"real\" cause of the Dragon War. Propaganda or history? |\n\n### Relations: The Full Picture\n\n**Aloria**: Mutual contempt. Neither can conquer the other. Cold war maintained by economic necessity.\n\n**Veraheim**: Officially despised. Practically essential. Velindor has agents there; Vera knows and tolerates them.\n\n**Broken Isles**: Beneath notice—except the pirates raid Imperial shipping constantly. Caerwyn wants a punitive expedition; Faendril says they can't afford it.\n\n---",
