  "rawContent": "# Aelindor - The Eternal City\n\n**Type**: Imperial Capital  \n**Population**: ~50,000 elves  \n**Location**: Central western lands, heart of the Thelassian  \n**Ruler**: Emperor Valandor Aethril  \n**Significance**: Seat of the Eternal Throne, home of the Four Pillars, center of elven civilization\n\n---\n\n## At a Glance\n\nAelindor is not merely a city—it is a statement carved in white stone and silver spires. For 1,500 years, the Eternal City has stood as the heart of elven civilization, its architecture proclaiming a simple truth: **the closer to the center, the closer to power**.\n\nFrom any approach, travelers see the same breathtaking silhouette: four great towers rising like fingers around a central spire that pierces the sky itself. The Eternal Spire—seat of Emperor Valandor—stands taller than anything else in the known world, visible from three days' journey in clear weather.\n\n*Common saying: \"All roads lead to Aelindor. All eyes look up.\"*\n\n---\n\n## City Structure - The Rings of Power\n\nAelindor is built in **concentric rings**, each representing a tier of elven society. Movement toward the center means ascent in status—a geography of hierarchy.\n\n```\n                    ┌─────────────────────┐\n                    │   THE OUTER WOODS   │  (Farms, wilderness buffer)\n                    │  ┌───────────────┐  │\n                    │  │  THE SUBURBS  │  │  (Common elves, new families)\n                    │  │ ┌───────────┐ │  │\n                    │  │ │ OUTER CITY│ │  │  (Crafters, markets, guilds)\n                    │  │ │ ┌───────┐ │ │  │\n                    │  │ │ │ INNER │ │ │  │  (Noble houses, ancient families)\n                    │  │ │ │ CITY  │ │ │  │\n                    │  │ │ │┌─────┐│ │ │  │\n                    │  │ │ ││CROWN││ │ │  │  (Four Towers + Eternal Spire)\n                    │  │ │ │└─────┘│ │ │  │\n                    │  │ │ └───────┘ │ │  │\n                    │  │ └───────────┘ │  │\n                    │  └───────────────┘  │\n                    └─────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Crown - Heart of the Empire\n\n### Overview\n\nThe innermost circle, called **The Crown**, contains the five most important structures in the Thelassian: the four Pillar Towers and the Eternal Spire at their center. This is where the Empire is governed, where law is made, and where power resides.\n\n**Access**: Restricted. Only those with official business, noble blood, or imperial summons may enter. Guards at each gate check credentials. Common elves may never set foot here in their entire lives.\n\n---\n\n### The Eternal Spire - Seat of the Emperor\n\n**Height**: 400 feet (the tallest structure in Exilium)  \n**Material**: White marble veined with silver, said to be quarried from a mountain that no longer exists  \n**Age**: Original construction 1,500+ years ago, maintained perfectly\n\n**Description**:  \nThe Eternal Spire rises from the exact center of Aelindor like a blade pointed at the heavens. Its surface is seamless—no visible blocks, no joints, as if grown rather than built. At night, soft silver light emanates from within, visible for miles. The spire narrows as it rises, culminating in a crystal apex that catches the first light of dawn and the last light of dusk.\n\n**Interior**:\n- **Ground Level**: The Throne Hall - where Emperor Valandor holds formal court\n- **Lower Levels**: Administrative offices, archives, servants' quarters\n- **Middle Levels**: Imperial apartments, guest chambers for dignitaries\n- **Upper Levels**: The Emperor's private chambers (few have ever seen them)\n- **The Apex**: Unknown - only Valandor ascends to the top\n\n**The Throne Hall**:  \nA vast circular chamber with a domed ceiling painted with star maps showing the sky as it appeared 1,500 years ago. The Eternal Throne sits on a raised dais of seven steps—one for each century of Valandor's early reign. The throne itself is carved from a single piece of white wood from a tree that died a thousand years ago. Petitioners approach from the single entrance opposite the throne, walking 200 feet under the Emperor's gaze.\n\n---\n\n### The Four Towers\n\nArranged in a perfect square around the Eternal Spire, each tower houses one of the Four Pillars and their institutions. Each tower reflects the nature of its Pillar in architecture and atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n#### The Iron Tower - Wardens of the Realm (1st Pillar)\n**Pillar Leader**: High Warden [Caerwyn](/npcs/high-warden-caerwyn)  \n**Height**: 300 feet  \n**Material**: White stone reinforced with dark iron bands  \n**Appearance**: Austere, martial, functional - no decorative elements\n\n**Description**:  \nThe Iron Tower looks like what it is: a fortress. Angular and severe, it stands in deliberate contrast to the elegant spires around it. Iron bands spiral up its height—functional reinforcement that also serves as a reminder that beauty without strength is weakness. The tower has no windows below 100 feet; arrow slits only above that.\n\n**Interior**:\n- **Ground Level**: The Hall of Fallen Knights - memorial to Dragon Knights who died in the Dragon War, empty pedestals where dragon saddles once hung\n- **Training Levels**: Combat arenas, strategy rooms, weapons vaults\n- **Barracks**: Elite guard quarters, officer chambers\n- **Command Level**: Caerwyn's war room, with maps of the entire Empire\n- **The Eyrie**: Top level, once used for dragon landings, now an observation post\n\n**Atmosphere**: Disciplined silence. Footsteps echo on stone. Guards stand motionless for hours. Everything is clean, ordered, purposeful. The weight of 400 years without dragons hangs heavy.\n\n**The Dragon Knight Memorial**:  \nIn the entrance hall, 47 empty armor stands form two lines—one for each Dragon Knight who died in the Dragon War. Their armor remains, polished daily, but no elf wears it. At the hall's end, a 48th stand holds [Thaelen Ruincalen](/npcs/thaelen-ruincalen)'s armor, turned to face the wall. The plaque reads only: \"The Last. The Lost.\"\n\n---\n\n#### The Silvered Tower - Council of Memory (2nd Pillar)\n**Pillar Leader**: First Remembrancer [Thaelorin](/npcs/first-remembrancer-thaelorin)  \n**Height**: 280 feet  \n**Material**: White stone with silver inlay forming endless knotwork patterns  \n**Appearance**: Covered in carved text - the tower itself is a book\n\n**Description**:  \nEvery inch of the Silvered Tower's exterior is carved with text—laws, histories, treaties, poems. The oldest carvings near the base are worn smooth by time; new additions appear near the top. Silver inlay traces patterns between the texts, connecting related passages across centuries. Scholars spend lifetimes studying just the exterior.\n\n**Interior**:\n- **Ground Level**: The Hall of Echoes - where legal proceedings are heard, acoustics designed so whispers carry to the judge's seat\n- **Archive Levels**: Countless floors of records, scrolls, books - the complete history of elven civilization\n- **The Remembrance Chambers**: Where the 100-Year Review trials take place\n- **Thaelorin's Study**: Said to contain books that exist nowhere else\n- **The Apex Chamber**: Where the most dangerous knowledge is kept (sealed)\n\n**Atmosphere**: Hushed reverence. The smell of old paper and preservation magic. Soft light from enchanted globes. Scribes moving silently between shelves. Time feels slower here, as if the weight of history presses down.\n\n**The Living Record**:  \nA unique feature: one wall in the main archive is blank white stone. When significant events occur anywhere in the Empire, text appears on this wall automatically—a magical record that cannot be falsified. The wall has been filling for 1,500 years. It is nearly full.\n\n---\n\n#### The Twilight Tower - Twilight Assembly (3rd Pillar)\n**Pillar Leader**: Starwarden [Isileth](/npcs/starwarden-isileth)  \n**Height**: 320 feet  \n**Material**: Pale blue-white stone that shifts color with the light  \n**Appearance**: Ethereal, seemingly lighter than air, decorated with star motifs\n\n**Description**:  \nThe Twilight Tower appears to glow faintly at all hours, brightest at dawn and dusk. Its stone—quarried from unknown sources—shifts from pale blue in morning light to silver at noon to soft violet at sunset. Star patterns are carved into every surface, and on clear nights, the tower seems to reflect the actual sky. Many swear it's taller than it looks, or that the stars on its surface move.\n\n**Interior**:\n- **Ground Level**: The Receiving Hall - where foreign dignitaries are welcomed, decorated with gifts from a thousand years of diplomacy\n- **Cultural Levels**: Museums of elven art, music halls, preservation of ancient traditions\n- **The Observatories**: Multiple levels devoted to studying stars and reading omens\n- **Diplomatic Chambers**: Where treaties are negotiated, designed to impress and intimidate\n- **Isileth's Sanctum**: A meditation chamber open to the sky\n\n**Atmosphere**: Dreamlike. Light behaves strangely—no harsh shadows, no glare. Soft music seems to come from nowhere. Visitors often lose track of time. The air smells of night-blooming flowers regardless of season.\n\n**The Star Map**:  \nThe main observatory contains a three-dimensional map of the night sky, crafted from thousands of tiny lights suspended in darkness. It shows the sky as it will appear, not as it appears now—Isileth claims it displays the future, though she won't say how far ahead.\n\n---\n\n#### The Granite Tower - Circle of Stewards (4th Pillar)\n**Pillar Leader**: First Steward [Faendril](/npcs/first-steward-faendril)  \n**Height**: 260 feet (shortest of the four, but widest)  \n**Material**: Grey granite with gold veining - practical, solid, wealthy  \n**Appearance**: Broader than tall, built for function over form, multiple wings\n\n**Description**:  \nThe Granite Tower is the most \"normal\" of the four—and intentionally so. While others reach for the sky, this tower sprawls outward, its multiple wings housing the bureaucracy that actually runs the Empire. Gold veining in the granite reminds visitors that administration controls the treasury. It's the least beautiful tower and the most important for daily life.\n\n**Interior**:\n- **Ground Level**: The Hall of Petitions - where citizens bring grievances, requests, and paperwork\n- **Administrative Wings**: Hundreds of offices managing trade, infrastructure, census, taxation\n- **The Counting Halls**: Where the Empire's wealth is tracked (not stored—that's elsewhere)\n- **The Office of Lesser Peoples**: Entire wing devoted to managing non-elven populations\n- **Faendril's Office**: Surprisingly modest, but with windows overlooking all approaches to the city\n\n**Atmosphere**: Busy. Unlike the other towers' reverent silence, the Granite Tower hums with activity. Clerks hurry between offices. Petitioners wait in queues. The sound of quills on paper is constant. This is where things get done.\n\n**The Provision Maps**:  \nFaendril's office contains massive maps showing real-time trade flows between all ten enclaves. Colored threads connect cities, their thickness indicating volume. A glance tells him the economic health of the entire Empire. One thread leads to [Veraheim](/factions/veraheim-the-sanctuary)—he looks at it often, expression unreadable.\n\n---\n\n### The Crown Plaza\n\nThe space between the four towers and around the Eternal Spire is the **Crown Plaza**—the most prestigious address in the Empire. Paved in white stone with silver inlay forming a massive star pattern, the plaza hosts:\n\n- **Imperial ceremonies** (coronations, though there's only been one)\n- **The Festival of Starlight** (annual celebration)\n- **Executions of traitors** (rare, and never elves)\n- **Diplomatic receptions** (foreign dignitaries presented here)\n\nThe plaza is always immaculate. A dedicated staff of 50 maintains it. A single leaf out of place is a scandal.\n\n---\n\n## The Inner City - Ring of Noble Houses\n\n### Overview\n\nSurrounding the Crown, the Inner City houses the **ancient noble families** of the Thelassian. These are elves whose bloodlines stretch back millennia, whose houses have stood since before Valandor's reign. Land here is never sold—only inherited. A family losing their Inner City residence is a catastrophic fall from grace.\n\n**Character**: Wide streets of white stone, lined with ancient trees. Elegant mansions behind high walls. Private gardens visible through wrought silver gates. Absolute silence—noise is considered vulgar. Servants move unseen through back passages.\n\n---\n\n### Notable Locations\n\n#### The Crescent Gardens\nPublic gardens (rare in the Inner City) forming a crescent moon shape around the northern approach to the Crown. Ancient trees, reflecting pools, sculptures by artists dead for centuries. Where noble families \"accidentally\" encounter each other for political conversations.\n\n#### The Hall of Lineages\nA registry building containing the official records of every noble house—births, deaths, marriages, disgraces. Managed by the Council of Memory. Falsifying a lineage record is punishable by exile.\n\n#### The Silver Amphitheater\nAn outdoor theater for performances of classical elven drama, music, and poetry. Performances happen perhaps twice a year—each one a major social event. Seating is assigned by family status. Wars have started over seat assignments.\n\n#### The Ancestor Shrines\nEach noble house maintains a private shrine to their ancestors. Once per year, on the anniversary of the house's founding, they hold remembrance ceremonies. Other houses send representatives based on alliance and respect.\n\n---\n\n### Housing Hierarchy\n\nThe Inner City is divided into four quadrants, each aligned with one of the Pillar Towers:\n\n| Quadrant | Aligned Pillar | Residents | Character |\n|----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Iron Quadrant** | Wardens | Military nobility, old warrior houses | Austere, martial décor |\n| **Silver Quadrant** | Memory | Scholar families, legal dynasties | Libraries, quiet gardens |\n| **Twilight Quadrant** | Assembly | Diplomatic houses, artistic families | Elegant, mysterious |\n| **Granite Quadrant** | Stewards | Administrative nobility, trade princes | Wealthy, practical |\n\n**Proximity Rule**: Houses closest to \"their\" tower have the strongest ties to that Pillar. A military family near the Iron Tower has generations of service to the Wardens. Moving closer to a different tower signals shifting allegiance—a political statement.\n\n---\n\n## The Outer City - Ring of Commerce\n\n### Overview\n\nBeyond the Inner City's noble estates lies the **Outer City**—the beating commercial heart of Aelindor. This is where goods are made, sold, and traded. Where guilds hold power. Where an elf of common birth can rise through skill and business acumen.\n\n**Character**: Narrower streets, but still clean and well-maintained. Shop fronts with elegant signs. Guild halls with proud banners. The sound of craftwork—but refined, never crude. Even commerce is conducted with elven dignity.\n\n---\n\n### The Great Market\n\nThe largest open space in the Outer City, the Great Market operates on a schedule refined over centuries:\n\n- **Dawn**: Fresh food, flowers, perishables\n- **Morning**: Crafted goods, tools, practical items\n- **Afternoon**: Luxury goods, art, rare materials\n- **Evening**: The market closes (night markets are considered vulgar)\n\n**Foreign traders** may sell here, but only from designated stalls at the market's edge. They pay triple fees. Their goods are inspected for \"quality\" (an excuse to reject anything too competitive with elven crafts).\n\n---\n\n### The Guild Quarters\n\nEach major craft has its own quarter within the Outer City:\n\n#### The Weavers' Lane\nTextile production—silk, enchanted cloth, ceremonial garments. The finest weavers can spend a decade on a single tapestry. Guild masters here dress better than some Inner City nobles.\n\n#### The Shapers' District\nWoodworking, though \"shaping\" is the preferred term. Elven furniture isn't carved—it's \"convinced\" to grow into shape through patient decades of cultivation. A master shaper's waiting list spans centuries.\n\n#### The Melodium\nDistrict devoted to musical instrument crafting. The instruments made here are played across the Empire. A Melodium-certified lute is worth more than some houses. Testing new instruments creates a constant ambient music.\n\n#### The Bottled Garden\nAlchemy, herbalism, perfumery. Smells shift street by street—florals, then medicinals, then the sharp scent of alchemical processes. The Guild of Essences controls what scents are \"appropriate\" for each social class.\n\n#### The Forge Ring\nMetalworking—but not crude smithing. Jewelry, decorative metalwork, fine weapons. Actual heavy industry happens elsewhere. The Forge Ring produces art that happens to be functional.\n\n---\n\n### Notable Locations\n\n#### The Stranger's Gate\nThe main entrance to the Outer City for non-elves. Foreign merchants, diplomats' servants, and the rare non-elven visitors enter here. They're given tokens indicating how deep into the city they may travel. Most never pass the Outer City.\n\n#### The Hall of Guilds\nCentral meeting place for all guild masters. Disputes between guilds are settled here. Economic policy affecting the Outer City is debated (but the Circle of Stewards has final say). An impressive building, but deliberately less grand than anything in the Inner City.\n\n#### The Twilight Market\nA smaller market that operates at dusk—technically legal, but socially questionable. Where slightly unusual goods are sold: foreign curiosities, items of ambiguous provenance, services best not discussed openly. The guard presence is lighter here. Intentionally.\n\n---\n\n## The Suburbs - Ring of Common Lives\n\n### Overview\n\nBeyond the Outer City walls, the **Suburbs** spread outward—home to common elves, newer families, and those who serve the inner rings. This is where most of Aelindor's 50,000 residents actually live. Clean, orderly, but clearly lower status than the rings within.\n\n**Character**: Smaller homes, but still elegant by human standards. Community gardens replace private estates. Neighborhood temples to <span class=\"broken-link\" title=\"Page not found: Vaelithar\">Vaelithar</span>. The sound of children (rare in inner rings, where families are small and formal).\n\n---\n\n### Social Structure\n\nThe Suburbs have their own internal hierarchy:\n\n**Inner Suburbs** (closest to Outer City walls):\n- Successful craftsmen who couldn't afford Outer City shops\n- Servants of noble houses (live close to work)\n- Guild journeymen working toward master status\n- Families on the rise, saving for generations to move inward\n\n**Middle Suburbs**:\n- Average elven families—craftsmen, farmers, laborers\n- Community-focused life with neighborhood councils\n- Most \"normal\" elven experience\n- Where young elves grow up before seeking fortune in inner rings\n\n**Outer Suburbs** (edge of the city):\n- Newest families, recent arrivals from other enclaves\n- Those who've fallen from higher status\n- Elves who prefer distance from the center (rare, viewed suspiciously)\n- The working class that keeps the city functioning\n\n---\n\n### Notable Locations\n\n#### The Rings Road\nCircular road marking each boundary between suburban sections. Status is measured by which Ring Road you live inside. \"She lives past the Third Ring\" is a polite way of saying someone is poor.\n\n#### The Community Temples\nUnlike the grand shrine in the Crown, suburban temples to Vaelithar are modest, community-run affairs. Priests here are local elves, not professional clergy. Services focus on daily life, not cosmic destiny.\n\n#### The Youth Academies\nWhere young elves receive basic education before specializing. Academies compete for students who show promise—a talented youth from the outer suburbs might earn sponsorship to an Inner City school, beginning a family's multi-generational climb toward the center.\n\n#### The Memorial Woods\nAt the city's edge, a forest where deceased common elves are buried (nobles have family crypts). Trees are planted over graves, so the forest grows as generations pass. Some trees are over a thousand years old. Families visit their ancestors' trees regularly.\n\n---\n\n## The Outer Woods - Beyond the City\n\n### Overview\n\nAelindor doesn't end sharply—it fades into managed forest. The **Outer Woods** serve as buffer, resource, and controlled wilderness. Technically part of the city's territory, but wild compared to the ordered rings within.\n\n**Contents**:\n- Managed timber forests (trees grown for centuries before harvesting)\n- Hunting grounds for nobility (common elves may not hunt here)\n- Hermitages for elves seeking solitude (requires permission)\n- Hidden paths known only to the Wardens (military routes)\n- The first checkpoint for anyone approaching the city\n\n---\n\n## Daily Life in Aelindor\n\n### Movement Between Rings\n\nTravel toward the center requires **increasing justification**:\n\n| From → To | Requirements |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| Outer Woods → Suburbs | None (public roads) |\n| Suburbs → Outer City | None, but guards note faces |\n| Outer City → Inner City | Business purpose or noble escort |\n| Inner City → The Crown | Official summons or noble blood |\n\n**Moving outward** is unrestricted. The assumption: why would anyone choose to move away from power?\n\n---\n\n### The Contribution System\n\nAelindor runs on service, not wages:\n\n- **Noble houses** contribute military service, governance, cultural preservation\n- **Guilds** contribute goods and training\n- **Common elves** contribute labor, crafts, food production\n- **In return**: Housing, food, security, medical care, education\n\n**Currency exists** but is used mainly for luxuries and external trade. Basic needs are provided based on contribution. This works because elves:\n- Live centuries (investment in citizens pays off)\n- Value community over individual wealth\n- Have cultural shame around poverty (rare, but devastating)\n\n---\n\n### Social Mobility\n\nMoving inward—physically and socially—takes generations:\n\n**How Families Rise**:\n1. Excel at a craft or profession (50-100 years)\n2. Gain guild recognition or noble patronage (100-200 years)\n3. Accumulate enough prestige for better housing (another century)\n4. Children start from higher position, continue climbing\n5. After 500-1000 years, a family might reach the Inner City\n\n**How Families Fall**:\n1. Disgrace (crime, scandal, political failure)\n2. Loss of craft relevance (your specialty becomes obsolete)\n3. Failure to produce heirs (family line ends)\n4. Backing the wrong side in Pillar politics\n5. Can happen in a single generation\n\n---\n\n## Politics and Power\n\n### The Balance of Towers\n\nThe Four Pillars cooperate publicly but compete privately. Their towers' proximity to the Eternal Spire is equal—by design—but influence shifts over centuries.\n\n**Current Balance**:\n- **Iron Tower**: Weakened since Dragon War (400 years ago); Thaelen's defection was another blow\n- **Silvered Tower**: Strong—Thaelorin's knowledge is irreplaceable\n- **Twilight Tower**: Rising—foreign affairs matter more as Veraheim complicates everything\n- **Granite Tower**: Essential—Faendril's control of economy gives practical power\n\n**The Emperor's Role**: Valandor maintains balance. When one Pillar grows too strong, he quietly elevates another. 1,500 years of practice has made him expert at this.\n\n---\n\n### Noble House Politics\n\nThe Inner City houses play a slower game than the Pillars:\n\n- **Alliances** form through marriage, mentorship, and shared interest\n- **Rivalries** last centuries, remembered long after original cause is forgotten\n- **Favors** are currency—a house that helped yours 300 years ago expects reciprocation\n- **Patience** is essential—the elf who acts hastily loses\n\n**The Great Houses** (oldest, closest to Crown):\n- House Aeravel - traditional military service (Iron aligned)\n- House Thelindor - legal scholars for generations (Silver aligned)\n- House Vaelindis - diplomats and artists (Twilight aligned)\n- House Caemorn - trade and administration (Granite aligned)\n\n---\n\n## Secrets of Aelindor\n\n### What Few Know\n\n**The Spire's Foundation**:  \nThe Eternal Spire is built atop something older. Deep below, sealed chambers contain... what? Even Valandor may not know entirely. Thaelorin's archives reference \"the foundation pact\" but pages are missing.\n\n**The Living Wall**:  \nThe Living Record in the Silvered Tower has nearly filled its wall. What happens when it runs out of space? Does the magic simply stop? Or does something else happen?\n\n**The Fifth Tower**:  \nAncient plans show a fifth tower that was never built—or was destroyed so completely no trace remains. Its planned location is now the Crown Plaza. No records explain why.\n\n**The Dragon Perches**:  \nThe Iron Tower's top level wasn't always called the Eyrie. It was built with perches for dragons. Caerwyn has never sealed them off. Some say he waits.\n\n**The Twilight Doors**:  \nIn the Twilight Tower, there are doors that don't open. Not locked—the walls around them simply won't permit passage. Isileth knows what's behind them. She doesn't speak of it.\n\n---\n\n## Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Summoned to the Crown** | PCs receive imperial summons. What does the Emperor want with outlanders? |\n| **The Guild Dispute** | A craft guild in the Outer City hires PCs for... discrete work against a rival. |\n| **The Fallen House** | A noble family faces disgrace. Can PCs find evidence to clear them—or is the evidence real? |\n| **The Twilight Market** | Something's being sold that shouldn't exist. Where did it come from? |\n| **The Memorial Tree** | A dead elf's tree in the Memorial Woods is dying unnaturally. What does it mean? |\n| **The Fifth Tower** | Someone's found architectural plans that shouldn't exist. Now they're missing. |\n\n---\n\n## Connections Map\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Crown[\"👑 THE CROWN\"]\n        Spire[\"Eternal Spire<br/>Emperor Valandor\"]\n        Iron[\"Iron Tower<br/>Caerwyn\"]\n        Silver[\"Silvered Tower<br/>Thaelorin\"]\n        Twilight[\"Twilight Tower<br/>Isileth\"]\n        Granite[\"Granite Tower<br/>Faendril\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Inner[\"🏛️ INNER CITY\"]\n        Nobles[\"Noble Houses\"]\n        Gardens[\"Crescent Gardens\"]\n        Lineages[\"Hall of Lineages\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Outer[\"🏪 OUTER CITY\"]\n        Market[\"Great Market\"]\n        Guilds[\"Guild Quarters\"]\n        Stranger[\"Stranger's Gate\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Suburbs[\"🏠 SUBURBS\"]\n        Common[\"Common Elves\"]\n        Temples[\"Community Temples\"]\n        Academy[\"Youth Academies\"]\n    end\n    \n    Spire --> Iron & Silver & Twilight & Granite\n    Crown --> Inner\n    Inner --> Outer\n    Outer --> Suburbs\n    \n    style Spire fill:#d9d2e9,color:#000\n    style Crown fill:#f3e5f5,color:#000\n    style Inner fill:#e8eaf6,color:#000\n    style Outer fill:#e3f2fd,color:#000\n    style Suburbs fill:#e8f5e9,color:#000\n```\n\n---\n\n## DM Notes\n\n**Themes to Emphasize**:\n- **Hierarchy is physical**: Status literally determines where you live\n- **Time moves differently**: A \"recent\" scandal is 50 years old\n- **Beauty masks control**: Everything is elegant; everything is regulated\n- **Patience is power**: Rushing is for lesser races\n\n**For Players Visiting**:\n- The beauty should be oppressive as much as impressive\n- They'll be watched constantly, judged constantly\n- Social mistakes matter—but elves won't tell them they've erred\n- The further in they go, the more dangerous mistakes become\n\n**Contrast with Veraheim**:\n- Veraheim: messy, diverse, alive, chaotic, accepting\n- Aelindor: perfect, uniform, ancient, ordered, exclusive\n- Both work.
