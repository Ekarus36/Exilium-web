  "rawContent": "# Vaelorin Spellward\n\n**Arcane Sentinel** | Twilight Tower (Court Position)\n\n> *\"Magic is not theater. Magic is security. I provide both.\"*\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Age** | 480 years |\n| **Race** | High Elf, Male |\n| **Role** | Court Mage, Magical Security |\n| **Reports To** | Starwarden Isileth |\n| **Location** | Eternal Spire and Twilight Tower |\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nVaelorin Spellward is the Empire's official court mage—responsible for magical security, ceremonial magic, and detecting arcane threats. He wards the Crown Plaza, examines magical items brought before the Emperor, and neutralizes magical attacks. Less mystical than Isileth, more practical.\n\n---\n\n## Personality & Approach\n\nProfessional, slightly paranoid, always analyzing. Sees magical threats everywhere—because they exist everywhere. Takes his protective duties seriously; considers ceremony secondary to security. Dry humor about the creative ways people try to smuggle magic past him.\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts\n\n- Has detected and neutralized 30+ magical threats over his career\n- Maintains the wards on Crown Plaza\n- Examines all magical gifts before they reach the Emperor\n- Can identify most enchantments on sight\n\n---\n\n## Secret (DM Only)\n\nThe wards on the Eternal Spire weren't made by elves. They're older, more powerful, and he doesn't fully understand them. He maintains what he can, but the core protections are beyond his ability to modify. This terrifies him.\n\n---\n\n## Connections\n\n- **Isileth**: Superior - Reports magical matters to her\n- **Thandril Ironsong**: Colleague - Coordinates magical and physical security\n- **Velindor Shadowmere**: Professional - Sometimes consulted on magical threats\n",
