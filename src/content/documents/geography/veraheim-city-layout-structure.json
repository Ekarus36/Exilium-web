Cisterns? Mountain springs?\n- Waste management?\n\n### Lighting\n- Torches? Magical lights?\n- Who maintains city lighting?\n\n### Temperature Control\n- Mountain city - cold?\n- Heating systems?\n- Natural insulation from stone?\n\n---\n\n## Social Dynamics by Level\n\n### Lower Plaza (Level 1)\n- Most diverse\n- Constant activity\n- Temporary residents\n- Commercial bustle\n- Gateway to city\n\n### Crafter's District (Level 2)\n- Permanent residents\n- Community identity\n- Pride in craftsmanship\n- Social cohesion\n- \"Real\" Veraheim\n\n### Grand Castle (Level 3)\n- Elite and privileged\n- Access restricted?\n- Political center\n- Distance from common folk\n- Does this create resentment?\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Develop\n\n1. **East and West Lift Placement**: Which level? Separate platforms or integrated into Lower Plaza?\n\n2. **Population Estimate**: How many people per level? Total city population?\n\n3. **Vertical Movement**: Just the stairs? Or other ways to move between levels?\n\n4. **The Castle Interior**: Specific rooms, layout, Vera and Galdor's private quarters?\n\n5. **Guard Distribution**: Where are guards stationed beyond the lift platforms?\n\n6. **Missing Services**: \n   - Temples/religious spaces?\n   - Schools/education?\n   - Healing/medical?\n   - Entertainment venues?\n\n7. **The Contribution System Details**:\n   - Who decides housing assignments?\n   - Can you move up in housing tier?\n   - What if you lose your job?\n   - Waiting list for housing?\n\n---\n\n## To Name\n\n- Specific taverns and inns (Crafter's District level)\n- Notable shops in Lower Plaza\n- Specific workshops/craftsmen in Crafter's Plaza\n- Guard commanders who live in Castle\n- Areas/districts (do they have informal names?)\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\nThis **three-tier system** reinforces Veraheim's meritocracy:\n- Everyone earns their place\n- Work determines your housing\n- No inherited wealth or property\n- Mobility is possible through contribution\n- Vera's vision made physical\n\nThe **vertical layout** naturally separates:\n- Trade (bottom)\n- Creation (middle)  \n- Administration (top)\n\nBut all are connected by the stairs - literal and symbolic upward mobility.\n",
