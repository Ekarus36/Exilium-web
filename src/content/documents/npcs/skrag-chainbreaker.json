  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nEnormous even for a bugbear (8 feet tall). Massively muscled, covered in coarse black fur. Yellow eyes, always calculating. Scarred face, broken nose, permanent scowl. Heavy iron chains wrapped around his forearms—weapons and symbol. Moves with predatory stillness, quiet for his size. He looks like a nightmare given flesh. That's intentional.\n\n### Personality\nPure business. No sadism for its own sake (inefficient). Cargo must arrive in sellable condition. Damage to merchandise is waste. No moral qualms about his trade. Doesn't enjoy cruelty, doesn't avoid it either. People are product. Everything is profit calculation.\n\n### The Operation\n- 8 purpose-built slaver ships with modified holds\n- Targets: isolated villages, ships with valuable passengers, refugees\n- Process: raid, sort, transport, break resistance, sell\n- Main auction house in Saltmere\n- Holding facilities on Mistwood Island\n\n### \"Professional Standards\"\nHis slaves are \"well-maintained\"—fed enough, not beaten unnecessarily. This isn't mercy. Damaged goods sell poorly. Reputation for quality merchandise. Buyers know what they're getting from Skrag.\n\n### Known Relationships\n- **Queen Graza:** Pays substantial tribute. She tolerates him, doesn't like him.\n- **The Storm:** Doesn't participate in slaving but doesn't interfere. No conflict.\n- **Gorrath Bloodstone:** Mutual contempt. Orcs hate slavers. Open hostility.\n- **Other Captains:** Most avoid him socially. He doesn't care.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nSkrag is exactly the cold pragmatist he appears. \"Chainbreaker\" was given by other bugbears after he escaped Aloria captivity as a youth. He broke his chains. Now he chains others. He finds no irony in this: strength determines who wears chains and who holds them. His philosophy is simple and brutal.\n\n### The Darkest Trade\nWhat he doesn't advertise openly:\n- Children sold to \"various markets\" (the darkest trade)\n- Rumored breeding facility producing slaves born into captivity\n- Specialty merchandise for fighting pits and pleasure houses\n- \"Disposal\" of unprofitable stock (elderly, injured, strong-willed)\n\n### Target Selection\n- Isolated coastal villages (won't be missed)\n- Ships with valuable passengers\n- Refugee groups (already displaced)\n- Debtors and criminals (sometimes purchased legally)\n- **NOT** Broken Isles settlements (bad for business)\n\n### Markets and Buyers\n- Noble households (servants)\n- Mining operations (expendable labor)\n- Fighting pits (specific type)\n- Pleasure houses (specialized market)\n- Mainland black markets\n- Some reach the Empire illegally\n\n### The Gorrath Tension\nGorrath Bloodstone would love an excuse to kill Skrag. Orcs have strong cultural feelings about captivity. The tension is constant. If Skrag ever takes orc captives or raids settlements under orc protection, Gorrath will move against him—and many captains would look the other way.\n\n### What He Wants\n- Profit, always profit\n- Expand operations\n- Secure markets\n- Be left alone to do business\n\n### What He Fears\n- Markets drying up\n- Cargo revolts (slaves outnumber crew)\n- Gorrath finding an excuse\n- Heroes specifically targeting his operation\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Liberation** | PCs hired to free specific slaves from Skrag's operation. It's heavily guarded. |\n| **Inside Job** | Someone within Skrag's organization wants out and will trade information. |\n| **The Buyer** | PCs need something only Skrag can provide. The price is helping with a raid. |\n| **Gorrath's Patience Ends** | Orcs decide Skrag crossed a line. War between pirate captains. |\n| **The Escaped** | Former slaves band together for revenge. Need help. |\n| **Noble's Son** | Kingdom noble hires PCs to rescue kidnapped heir. Skrag has already sold him. |\n\n---",
