  "commonKnowledge": "### Physical Characteristics\n\n**Size Range:**\n- Hatchlings: 4-6 feet long\n- Juveniles: 15-25 feet\n- Adults: 30-50 feet (Thorongil is 38 feet)\n- Ancient Elders: 60-80 feet (rarely seen)\n\n**Lifespan:**\n- Hatchling (0-50 years): Learning, growing, protected by parents\n- Juvenile (50-150 years): Testing boundaries, first flights beyond territory\n- Young Adult (150-400 years): Establishing territory, potential bonding age\n- Adult (400-800 years): Prime of life, full powers\n- Elder (800-1200+ years): Wisdom phase, council participation, reduced activity\n- Ancient (1200+ years): Extremely rare, legendary figures\n\n**Breath Types** (varies by individual, not subspecies):\n- Cold (most common) - paralyzing gas, freezing breath\n- Fire (second most common)\n- Lightning (rare)\n- Acid (rare)\n- Mixed capabilities (very rare, marks exceptional individuals)\n\n### Diet and Hunting\n\n**Dragons are apex predators** who require substantial prey:\n\n**Primary Food Sources:**\n- Large mountain game: elk, wild boar, mountain goats, bears\n- Megafauna: rare giant elk, cave bears, woolly creatures in high peaks\n- Sea creatures: whales, giant squid, large sharks (coastal dragons)\n- Occasional livestock from lowlands\n\n**Hunting Territory:**\n- Each adult dragon claims a territory of roughly 50-100 square miles\n- Territories are defended fiercely against other dragons\n- Territory size limits dragon population naturally\n- The northwestern mountains support ~30-50 dragons sustainably\n\n**Feeding Frequency:**\n- Juveniles: Every few days (growing rapidly)\n- Adults: Every 1-2 weeks for a major hunt\n- Elders: Monthly or less (metabolisms slow with age)\n\n**Why They Avoid Civilization:**\n- Hunting near settlements causes conflict\n- Easier prey exists in mountains (wild herds, isolation)\n- Pride—dragons don't beg or steal\n- Historical trauma from the war\n\n### Thorongil's Arrangement\n\n**How Veraheim's dragon feeds:**\n\nThorongil's situation is unique. He can't access traditional dragon hunting grounds (other dragons would attack a traitor). His arrangement:\n\n1. **Mountain Hunting** (primary): Wild game in the Shieldwall mountains around Veraheim\n2. **\"Tribute\" Livestock** (supplemental): Both the Empire and Kingdom quietly \"lose\" livestock to \"mountain predators\"\n3. **Sea Hunting** (occasional): Flights to the coast for whales and large fish\n4. **Understood Limits**: Never takes from small farms or poor settlements\n\n**The unspoken deal:** Trade caravans passing through the tunnel sometimes \"mysteriously\" lose a cow or two. Merchants factor this into costs. No one complains because the alternative is no dragon protection.\n\n### Society Structure\n\n**Dragon society is loosely organized:**\n\n**The Elder Council:**\n- Oldest dragons (800+ years) form an informal governing body\n- Meets rarely (decades between gatherings)\n- Decides matters affecting all dragons: territory disputes, responses to threats\n- No single leader—decisions by consensus among those who care to attend\n\n**Social Organization:**\n- Dragons are primarily **solitary** (territorial needs)\n- Mated pairs share territory but often maintain separate lairs\n- Parents raise hatchlings together until juvenile phase (~50 years)\n- Juveniles leave to establish own territories or die trying\n- Elders sometimes gather for philosophical discussion\n\n**Communication:**\n- Draconic language (complex, includes subsonic tones humans can't hear)\n- Telepathic bonding (with chosen individuals—historically elves)\n- Territorial markers (scent, claw marks, magic-infused warnings)\n- Long-range calls (can be heard for miles)\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### The Retreat After the War\n\n**What really happened 400 years ago:**\n\nThe Dragon War killed dozens of dragons—many at the hands of their own former bond-partners when the bonds shattered. The survivors retreated to the mountains with one decree from the Elder Council:\n\n**\"No more bonds. No more trust. No more contact.\"**\n\nFor 400 years, they've held to this:\n- Young dragons who suggest approaching elves are shunned\n- Thorongil is considered the ultimate traitor (bonded to an elf, killed dragons, lives among \"the lesser races\")\n- Some dragons have died of the loneliness—the species is social despite its solitary nature\n\n**The hidden truth:**\n- Some elders know the truth—drow, not elves, caused the war\n- They haven't shared this widely (admitting the war was based on error is painful)\n- A few younger dragons wonder if reconciliation is possible\n- The oldest dragon, **Vaemorthax**, remembers before the war and grieves privately\n\n### Dragon Psychology\n\n**What drives them:**\n\n**Pride:** Dragons consider themselves the pinnacle of creation. Not arrogant—factual. They're the oldest sapient species, the most powerful, the wisest (in their view).\n\n**Longevity:** Living 1000+ years creates alien perspectives. A dragon's \"recent memory\" might be 200 years ago. They plan in centuries.\n\n**Territory:** Not greed—necessity. Dragons need space to hunt, to think, to exist. Crowding makes them violent.\n\n**Purpose:** Dragons fear meaninglessness more than death. A dragon with no purpose—no mate, no offspring, no project, no bond—becomes dangerous or despondent.\n\n**The Bonding Mystery:**\n- Dragons still don't fully understand why bonds formed with elves\n- Something in elven minds was compatible—long lives, magical affinity\n- Bonds were **chosen**, never forced\n- The torture in the war was an abomination—forcing bonds is like magical rape\n- Young dragons sometimes dream of bonding and wake ashamed\n\n### The Current Political Situation\n\n**Inside the mountains:**\n\n**Isolationist Majority** (~20 dragons):\n- \"The lesser races proved their nature. Stay away.\"\n- Led informally by **Vaemorthax** (1400+ years, oldest living dragon)\n- Will attack any dragon who suggests contact\n\n**Curious Minority** (~8 dragons):\n- Younger adults (200-400 years) who never knew bonds\n- Wonder if the punishment has gone on long enough\n- Secretly interested in what Thorongil chose\n- No leader—too dangerous to organize openly\n\n**The Undecided** (~10 dragons):\n- Elders who remember bonds and miss them\n- Adults who are simply tired of isolation\n- Won't act but might support change if someone else moves first\n\n**The Unknown Factor:**\n- 400 years of isolation may have produced dragons no one knows about\n- Rumored hatchlings raised in complete secrecy by isolationist parents\n- Possible small groups who've left the mountains entirely (no confirmation)\n\n### Thorongil's Status\n\n**Among his own kind:**\n\nThorongil is the dragon equivalent of a war criminal who defected to the enemy:\n- Fought against his own kind\n- Maintained a bond when others died or broke them\n- Lives among \"lesser races\" by choice\n- Has never returned to the mountains in 400 years\n\n**What other dragons think:**\n- Isolationists: Would kill him on sight\n- Curious minority: Fascinated but won't admit it\n- Elders who knew him: Grief, betrayal, confusion\n\n**What Thorongil thinks:**\n- He chose his bond over his species\n- They're right to call him traitor\n- He wouldn't change his choice\n- He's desperately lonely for dragon contact\n- Sometimes flies toward the mountains, stops before he's visible\n\n### Potential Storylines\n\n**The Dragon Emissary:**\nA young dragon approaches Veraheim. The isolationists want them dead. The curious minority wants to see what happens. Is it a trap, a peace offer, or a rogue acting alone?\n\n**Vaemorthax's Decision:**\nThe oldest dragon is dying. Before death, they might share the truth about the war. This could change everything—or spark dragon civil war.\n\n**The Lost Clutch:**\nRumors of dragon eggs hidden outside the mountains. If true, they could be raised without isolationist influence—or exploited by the powers.\n\n**Thorongil's Return:**\nSomething forces Thorongil to enter dragon territory. How do his people react? Can Thaelen follow? What happens to Veraheim without its protector?\n\n### What the Powers Know\n\n**Thelassian:**\n- Caerwyn (High Warden) has scouts watching the mountain borders\n- Isileth (Starwarden) believes reconciliation is possible—eventually\n- Velindor (Spymaster) has tried to contact dragons. Agents don't return.\n- Official policy: Dragons are a closed chapter\n\n**Aloria:**\n- Most Lords consider dragons legends or exaggerations\n- Lord Eisenwald believes a dragon could be captured and used (he's a fool)\n- The King knows better—his grandfather met Thorongil\n- Official policy: Ignore them and hope they keep ignoring us\n\n**Broken Isles:**\n- Vaelith Draegor (drow) knows what drow did 400 years ago\n- Some orc shamans claim to speak with \"dragon spirits\" (unverified)\n- Practical pirates don't sail near the northwestern coasts\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Messenger** | A young dragon lands near Veraheim with a message for Thorongil. The isolationists are coming to kill them. Protect the messenger? |\n| **The Truth Spreads** | Someone found records proving drow caused the war. If dragons learn the truth from the wrong source, it could mean war with drow survivors everywhere. |\n| **Vaemorthax Dying** | The oldest dragon sends word: they want to speak to Thorongil before death. Is it reconciliation or trap? |\n| **Egg Hunters** | Lord Eisenwald funded an expedition to find dragon eggs. They might succeed. The consequences would be catastrophic. |\n| **The Bond Dreams** | A young elf in Veraheim is having dreams about dragons. Real contact, or wishful thinking? Dragons in the mountains are having the same dreams. |\n| **Civil War** | The curious minority makes a move. The isolationists respond.
