  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nTall, rangy build of a woodsman. Weather-beaten face with laugh lines. Brown hair, green eyes. Simple dress—quality but not showy. Calloused hands because he actually works. Moves like a hunter. Speaks directly, sometimes to his political detriment.\n\n### Personality\nGenuinely honest—almost a disability at court. Values competence over birth. Uncomfortable with politics. Loyal friend, terrible enemy. Protective of his people and family. Prefers forests to castles. Keeps being surprised by political betrayals.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Marian (née Valcourt, 40) - Lord Valcourt's sister. Marriage became genuine love. More politically aware than Alaric.\n- **Heir:** Roland (20) - Honest like father, better at reading people. Capable ranger. Unmarried.\n- **Second Son:** Garrett (17) - Different from father—enjoys court games. Studies politics. Alaric doesn't know what to make of him.\n- **Sisters:** Helena (married to Lord Ashfeld), Greta (married to Lord Wolfstein).\n\n### Domain & Resources\nRules ~12,000 people in the ancient forests. Produces timber, famous Thornwood longbows, furs, and game. Commands 1,400 soldiers including 200 elite rangers—best archers in the Kingdom. The forests themselves are natural defense.\n\n### Political Position\nLoosely part of the Military Bloc through family connections (Greta married to Wolfstein). Friendly with the crown but not politically active. Other Lords respect his honesty even when they can't understand it.\n\n---",
