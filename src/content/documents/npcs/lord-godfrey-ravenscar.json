  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nTall, lean, aristocratic bearing. Sharp green eyes (family trait, shared with Queen Margarethe). Greying dark hair, receding slightly. Clean-shaven, strong jaw. Dresses in conservative dark colors. Carries himself with rigid formality. Follows protocol religiously.\n\n### Personality\nUtterly proper—tradition matters. Conservative, suspicious of change. Proud of his lineage to the point of arrogance. Looks down on \"newer\" noble families (Ashfeld, Blackthorne). Privately warmer than his public facade suggests, but few see that side.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Cordelia (née Valcourt, 42) - Lord Valcourt's sister. Practical, manages household efficiently.\n- **Heir:** Edmund (22) - Scholarly, dutiful, not the warrior father wanted. Betrothed to Marian Belmont.\n- **Second Son:** Marcus (19) - Natural warrior, serves in Royal Army. Everything Edmund isn't.\n- **Daughter:** Rowena (17) - Quiet, observant, close to Queen Margarethe.\n\n### Domain & Strength\nRules ~15,000 people in the northeast marshlands. Commands 2,500 quality soldiers—not the largest army but disciplined and reliable. The marshes themselves are natural defenses. Traditional shield between the capital and frontier threats.\n\n### Political Position\nLeader of the Loyalist faction alongside Königsford. His loyalty to the crown is absolute—not from love of Aldric personally, but from family honor and tradition. Competes with Königsford for royal favor.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nGodfrey is exactly what he appears to be—honorable, traditional, loyal. His rigidity isn't a mask; it's who he is. But this makes him predictable and sometimes blind. He can't imagine betrayal from within his own family, which makes Marcus's situation dangerous.\n\n### The Edmund Problem\nGodfrey wanted a warrior heir. He got a scholar. Edmund is intelligent, capable, and kind—none of which Godfrey values properly. His obvious disappointment has created a rift. Edmund tries desperately to please; Godfrey barely notices.\n\n### The Marcus Danger\nThe second son is what Godfrey wanted Edmund to be—bold, martial, confident. This creates terrible family dynamics:\n- Marcus secretly believes he'd be a better heir\n- Edmund knows their father prefers Marcus\n- **Lord Blackthorne's agents are recruiting Marcus**\n- Godfrey doesn't know (or won't see it)\n\nIf Marcus is turned, he could betray the entire Loyalist faction.\n\n### The Chronicle Room\nRavenscar Keep contains records going back centuries. Hidden among them:\n- Evidence of Graustein legitimacy questions (three generations back)\n- Documentation of Blackthorne atrocities\n- Old debts and broken promises\n- Godfrey hasn't used these—considers it beneath his honor\n- Someone less honorable could weaponize them\n\n### Hidden Concerns\n- Worried about Edmund's betrothal to Marian Belmont (she's too clever)\n- Suspects Blackthorne is dangerous but can't prove anything\n- Fears Prince Roderick's aggression will destabilize everything\n- Queen Margarethe asks him for things he doesn't fully understand\n\n### What He Wants\n- The Kingdom stable and orderly\n- His family's prestige maintained\n- Edmund to somehow become worthy\n- Traditional values preserved\n\n### What He Fears\n- Civil war\n- Being seen as \"just\" the Queen's nephew\n- His family's legacy ending\n- Change that undermines tradition\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Second Son** | Marcus is being turned by Blackthorne.
