It is automatically\ngenerated by the build scripts.\n\nFor usage with older browsers/environments, without native support for the\nlatest JavaScript features, please see the `legacy/` folder.\nPlease see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support) for information about supported browsers/environments.\n\nSee https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js for learning and contributing.\n",
