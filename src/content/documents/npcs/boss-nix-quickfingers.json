  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nSmall even for a goblin (3'2\"). Wiry, constantly in motion, can't sit still. Pale green skin, huge yellow darting eyes, enormous twitching ears. Wears an oversized captain's coat (stolen, too big, doesn't care). Long nimble fingers always fidgeting. Manic grin like he knows a joke no one else gets.\n\n### Personality\nNever stops moving. Talks fast, thinks faster. Five plans running simultaneously. Attention span of a caffeinated squirrel. Exhausting to be around. \"More is always better\" is his philosophy. Thirty ships? Why not fifty? Numbers, numbers, numbers.\n\n### The Swarm Fleet\n- 30+ small vessels (fluctuates constantly)\n- Each carries 8-15 goblins\n- ~400 crew across the fleet\n- All from Skarath goblin families\n- Fast, maneuverable, expendable, NUMEROUS\n\n### Swarm Tactics\nAgainst large ships: fifteen small ships surround, attack from all directions, board before they can respond. Can't fight them all at once. Death by a thousand cuts. If losing, scatter in thirty directions—enemy can only chase a few.\n\n### Famous Maneuver: \"The Net\"\nCircle target with fifteen+ boats. Throw grappling hooks from all sides. Board from every direction. Whole attack takes under ten minutes.\n\n### Known Relationships\n- **The Storm:** Absolutely terrified. Has ordered fleet to NEVER approach *Sorrow*. \"Some fights you run.\"\n- **The Rapier:** Mutual amusement. Different styles, same cockiness.\n- **The Admiral:** Contempt from Kozrek—\"undisciplined rabble.\" Nix escaped his trap once and bought five new boats with the profit.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nThe manic exterior hides sharp cunning. Coordinating thirty ships requires intelligence most don't credit him with. He knows exactly where every vessel is, tracks complex logistics, and plans multiple contingencies. Underestimating him is a mistake many have made once.\n\n### Why It Works\n- **Cheap:** Can replace losses easily\n- **Fast:** Outrun what they can't fight\n- **Nimble:** Go places big ships can't\n- **Numerous:** Overwhelm through count\n- **Disposable:** Losing one isn't catastrophic\n\n### The Skarath Connection\nNix is from Skarath, the goblin shipbuilding center. His family builds ships. He buys at discount. This is why he can maintain such a large fleet—wholesale prices from relatives. Threatening Skarath threatens his entire operation.\n\n### Revenue Streams\n- Standard piracy (cargo)\n- Transport for hire (move things quietly)\n- Scouting services (nobody watches waters like Nix)\n- Salvage operations (quick to reach wrecks)\n- Smuggling (small ships, hidden coves)\n\n### Goblin Logic\n- \"Fair fight\" means you planned poorly\n- Overwhelming force is the only force\n- Running away is valid tactic\n- Survival beats honor\n- Profit over pride\n\n### What He Wants\n- More ships (always more)\n- Fifty ships would be nice\n- Respect despite the jokes\n- His family's prosperity\n\n### What He Fears\n- The Storm (sensibly)\n- Storms (weather—small ships are vulnerable)\n- Losing coordination (thirty ships need communication)\n- Something hunting his ships (pirates don't just vanish...)\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Blockade** | Need to break a naval blockade? Nix's swarm is perfect distraction. |\n| **Missing Ships** | Several boats disappeared. Pirates don't just vanish. What's hunting them? |\n| **The Expansion** | Nix wants fifty ships. His moves threaten other captains' territories. |\n| **The Race** | Bet between Nix and The Rapier—who reaches a point first? Stakes are high. |\n| **Goblin Family Drama** | Conflict in Skarath threatens ship supply. He needs to solve family problems. |\n| **The Salvage** | Nix found something in a wreck. Something valuable. Something others want. |\n\n---",

Biggest single haul in his career.\n\n**The Kingdom Trap:** Spotted ambush, led warships into shallows where small boats thrive, captured one. Sold it (too big for his fleet).\n\n**The Scatter:** Cornered by The Admiral's fleet. Ordered scatter—thirty ships, thirty directions. Admiral caught three. Nix was back to strength in two months.\n\n**The Bridge:** Lined up twenty boats, tied them together, created floating bridge to move cargo past patrol. Gone before dawn.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n- Chaos with method\n- Numbers game personified\n- Natural contrast to single-ship captains\n- Skarath connection is vulnerability AND strength\n- Surprisingly competent beneath the mania\n",
