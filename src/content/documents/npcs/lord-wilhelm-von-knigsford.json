  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nPortly, comfortable build. Balding, compensates with elaborate hats. Shrewd brown eyes. Always smiling—it means nothing. Dresses in royal colors as subtle signal. Moves through court like water. Remembers everyone's name and preferences.\n\n### Personality\nProfessional courtier to his core. Says what people want to hear. Genuinely enjoys political games. Loyal to whoever benefits him most. Never commits to anything directly. Appears harmless—this is intentional and misleading.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Mathilde (née Belmont, 50) - Lord Belmont's sister. Smarter than Wilhelm, controls finances.\n- **Heir:** Friedrich (27) - Bland, follows rules, lacks initiative. Married to Princess Eleanora Greymont.\n- **Second Son:** Albrecht (24) - Has father's talents, resents being second. Building own power network.\n- **Daughter:** Liesel (20) - Socialite, expert at gathering information. Being positioned for advantageous marriage.\n\n### Domain & Position\nRules ~18,000 people around the capital. Primary value is location—every visitor to Thornreich passes through Königsford land. Commands 1,600 soldiers (parade-ready, untested). Real power is proximity and information.\n\n### Political Position\nPart of the Loyalist faction alongside Ravenscar, but they're rivals for royal favor. Has Prince Friedrich married to Princess Eleanora—a major coup (though Eleanora actually dominates that household).\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nWilhelm is exactly the political creature he appears to be. He has no ideology, no deep loyalties, no moral compass beyond self-interest. But he's not evil—he's a survivor. He's served three kings and countless political shifts by always being useful and never being threatening.\n\n### The Real Value\nWilhelm's true worth is information:\n- Knows everyone's secrets (and trades them carefully)\n- Controls who gets access to the capital\n- Observes everyone who passes through his lands\n- Has been doing this for 28 years\n\n### The Eleanora Situation\nThe marriage of Friedrich to Princess Eleanora was supposed to be a Königsford triumph.
