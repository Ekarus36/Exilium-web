  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nLooks strikingly like Thaelen—same strong features, same warrior's build—but aged by grief rather than time. Once wore his hair in military braids; now keeps it shorn short, a mark of mourning. Dresses in plain grey, no family colors. Moves like a fighter but carries no weapons. Eyes that have seen too much and expect nothing good.\n\n### Personality (Public)\nQuiet, withdrawn, consumed by shame. Speaks rarely and only when necessary. Accepts insults without response—he believes he deserves them. Works at menial tasks despite his skills. Some call it penance; others call it performance. He doesn't explain himself.\n\n### The Disgrace\nWhen Thaelen defected:\n- House Ruincalen lost its Inner City residence\n- Maethor was stripped of military rank\n- The family name became synonymous with betrayal\n- Other members scattered, changed names, or died of shame\n\n**Maethor's Choice:**\nHe didn't change his name. He didn't hide. He moved to the outer suburbs, took up simple work, and lives as a constant reminder that Ruincalen still answers for its son's betrayal.\n\n### His Daily Life\n- Works as a groundskeeper at the Memorial Woods\n- Tends the graves of common elves (far below his station)\n- Attends no social functions\n- Has refused all offers of reconciliation or restoration\n- Some nobles visit to insult him; he accepts it silently\n\n### Public Perception\n- **To traditionalists**: A noble example of accepting family shame\n- **To progressives**: A tragic waste of talent\n- **To the military**: A reminder of what they lost (both brothers were exceptional)\n- **To Caerwyn**: A painful sight (he served with both brothers)\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nMaethor Ruincalen is not performing penance. He is grieving. For 80 years, he has grieved not for his family's lost honor, but for his brother—alive somewhere, unreachable, lost to him forever.\n\nHe doesn't believe Thaelen is a traitor. He believes Thaelen fell in love and made an impossible choice. Maethor would never say this publicly—it would be treason. But in his heart, he understands. He might have done the same, if he'd ever loved anything the way Thaelen apparently loved Vera.\n\nThe penance is real, but it's not for Thaelen's crime. It's for his own failure: he didn't see his brother's pain, didn't notice him changing, didn't try to understand. He was so focused on duty that he lost his only family.\n\n### The Brothers' History\nMaethor is 80 years older than Thaelen. He practically raised him after their parents died in a border skirmish 350 years ago.\n\n**What Maethor Remembers:**\n- Teaching young Thaelen to hold a sword\n- Watching him earn his Dragon Knight armor\n- The pride when Thaelen surpassed him\n- The distance that grew between them as Thaelen bonded with Thorongil\n- The last conversation: routine, forgettable, about supplies for a mission\n\n**What He Regrets:**\nHe never asked Thaelen if he was happy. Never asked about his dreams, his doubts, his heart. They were brothers in name, strangers in truth. When Thaelen left, Maethor realized he'd never really known him at all.\n\n### The Hidden Correspondence\nOnce every decade, Maethor writes a letter to Thaelen. He doesn't send them—doesn't even know if they'd reach Veraheim. He just writes. About his life, about Aelindor, about their parents. About forgiveness he can't speak aloud.\n\nHe keeps the letters in a box. Eight letters over 80 years. If anyone found them, it would be treason.\n\n### What He Knows\n- He suspects Velindor Shadowmere monitors him (correct)\n- He knows Seraphel trained under Thaelen (watches her from afar)\n- He's heard rumors Thorongil still lives (hopes they're true)\n- He understands the Empire's flaws better than most (from the bottom looking up)\n\n### What He Wants\n- To see Thaelen one more time\n- To say what he should have said 80 years ago\n- To understand his brother's choice\n- Perhaps: to be forgiven for being a stranger in his brother's life\n\n### What He Fears\n- Thaelen dying before they can speak\n- Being right that he failed as a brother\n- His letters being discovered\n- Living another 400 years with this weight\n\n### The Unspoken Truth\nMaethor Ruincalen is the perfect person to bridge the Empire and Veraheim. He has credibility (he's suffered), family connection (Thaelen's brother), and genuine desire for reconciliation. If anyone could negotiate between Valandor and the defectors, it might be him.\n\nHe's never considered this. It would require hope he's afraid to feel.\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Message** | PCs carry a message from Thaelen. Finding Maethor is easy; earning his trust is hard. |\n| **The Letters** | Someone discovers his hidden correspondence. Blackmail? Sympathy? Exposure? |\n| **The Broker** | Isileth or another Pillar approaches him about being an unofficial envoy to Veraheim. |\n| **The Reconciliation** | Thaelen wants to meet. Maethor must decide: risk everything, or protect his penance? |\n| **The Truth** | He learns something about the original mission that changes everything—Thaelen was set up? |\n| **The Restoration** | The Emperor offers to restore House Ruincalen. At what price? |\n\n---",
