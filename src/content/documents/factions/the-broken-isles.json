  "commonKnowledge": "### The Major Settlements\n\n| Settlement | Pop. | Race | Industry |\n|------------|------|------|----------|\n| [Freehold Harbor](/geography/freehold-harbor) | 8-10K | Mixed | Pirate capital, neutral ground |\n| [Skarath](/geography/skarath) | 8K | Goblin | Shipbuilding |\n| [Ironhold](/geography/ironhold) | 6K | Hobgoblin | Weapons, metalwork |\n| [Stormcrag](/geography/stormcrag) | 5.5K | Orc | Farming, raiding, bonecraft |\n| [Saltmere](/geography/saltmere) | 5K | Mixed | Trade hub, black market |\n| [Mistwood](/geography/mistwood) | 1.5K | Bugbear | Hunting, monster parts, relics |\n\n### Government: The Moot\n\nQuarterly assembly at Freehold Harbor:\n- Each pirate captain = 1 vote\n- Each settlement = 1 vote\n- Pirate Monarch = tie-breaker\n- Major decisions require 2/3 majority\n\n### The Pirate Monarch\n\n**Current: [Graza Bloodtide](/npcs/graza-bloodtide)** (Queen, 3 years)\n\nPowers:\n- Commands largest official fleet\n- Collects tribute from captains\n- Enforces Harbor Peace\n- Settles major disputes\n- Coordinates defense\n\nSelection: Must command largest fleet (or build alliances). Confirmed by Moot. Can be challenged.\n\n### Harbor Peace\n\nThe sacred law:\n- Ships traveling to/from Freehold = protected\n- No violence in Freehold harbor\n- Violation = death from ALL captains\n\nWhy it works: Makes trade possible. Merchants can safely fence stolen goods. Creates true neutral ground.\n\n### The Races\n\n**Goblins** (Skarath): Chaotic but organized around profit. Build every ship. Corporate hierarchy.\n\n**Hobgoblins** (Ironhold): Militaristic, disciplined. Forge all weapons. Military oligarchy.\n\n**Orcs** (Stormcrag): Two allied clans. Farm the volcanic soil. Raid enemy shipping. Warrior honor culture.\n\n**Bugbears** (Mistwood): Mysterious hunters. No permanent settlements. Trade monster parts and ancient relics.\n\n**Mixed** (Freehold, Saltmere): All races welcome if they're useful. Goblins run most shops. Humans more common than on mainland.\n\n### Economy\n\n**Piracy**: Raiding Empire and Kingdom shipping\n**Trade**: Fencing stolen goods through Saltmere\n**Production**: Ships (Skarath), weapons (Ironhold), food (Stormcrag), exotic goods (Mistwood)\n**Services**: Shipbuilding, repairs, mercenaries, information\n\n### Why They Survive\n\nNeither the Empire nor Kingdom can destroy them:\n- Distance (two days' sail)\n- Geography (treacherous waters, many harbors)\n- The Storm (would unite all captains against invaders)\n- Cost (military expedition would be ruinous)\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### Vaelith Draegor: The True Ruler\n\n[Vaelith Draegor](/npcs/vaelith-the-storm-draegor)—called \"The Storm\"—is a 300-year-old drow who commands the dreadnought *Sorrow*. He doesn't claim the throne. He doesn't need to.\n\n**What he controls:**\n- Best ship in the Isles (could defeat any fleet)\n- Network of agents in every settlement\n- Information that could destroy any captain\n- The fear of every soul who sails these waters\n\n**His method:** He rarely acts. He doesn't need to. When The Storm appears, arguments end. When he speaks, everyone listens. The rest of the time, he watches from his ship, anchored wherever he pleases, and the Isles govern themselves knowing he's watching.\n\n**What he wants:** Unknown. He's kept the Isles stable for decades. He doesn't raid himself. He doesn't accumulate wealth. Some think he's building toward something. Others think he just enjoys power. No one knows—and no one dares ask.\n\n### Graza's Dilemma\n\n[Graza Bloodtide](/npcs/graza-bloodtide) is Pirate Queen, but she's not stupid. She knows The Storm tolerates her. If she ever truly challenged him, she'd lose.\n\n**Her strategy:**\n- Build alliances slowly\n- Strengthen her fleet\n- Prove herself indispensable\n- Wait for The Storm to die (he's mortal, theoretically)\n\n**Her fear:** What if he never dies? What if being Queen means being his puppet forever?\n\n**Her secret ambition:** She wants to be remembered as the Queen who made the Isles into a real nation. Not just pirates—a power that mainland respects. But she can't do that while The Storm exists.\n\n### The Confederation's Fragility\n\nThe Isles look united. They're not.\n\n**Fault lines:**\n- Goblins vs Hobgoblins (mutual contempt, essential trade)\n- Orc clans (alliance is 20 years old, blood feuds are centuries)\n- Freehold vs settlements (captains want freedom; settlements want order)\n- Old pirates vs new (traditions vs innovation)\n\n**What holds it together:**\n- The Storm's shadow\n- External threats (Empire, Kingdom)\n- Economic interdependence\n- Harbor Peace tradition\n\n**What could break it:**\n- The Storm's death (succession crisis)\n- Internal war (hobgoblins vs anyone)\n- External invasion (might unite them—or might not)\n- Economic collapse (if trade routes shift)\n\n### The Mainland Connections\n\nThe Isles aren't isolated:\n- Kingdom lords secretly fund pirates to raid rivals\n- Empire merchants secretly buy back stolen goods\n- Saltmere trades with both powers through intermediaries\n- Information flows both ways\n\n**[Delara Silvertongue](/npcs/delara-silvertongue)** (Saltmere) and **[Nix Quickfingers](/npcs/boss-nix-quickfingers)** (information broker) manage most mainland contacts. The Storm knows about all of it. He allows it because it keeps the Isles wealthy and stable.\n\n### What Sleeps in Mistwood\n\n[Mistwood](/geography/mistwood) hides something ancient. Chief Varka knows. She's sealed the deepest ruins. The Storm has sent agents to investigate; they keep dying.\n\n**What's there?** Something imprisoned long before the Confederation existed. The bugbears guard it. They don't talk about it. Even The Storm has learned not to push.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Storm's Absence** | Vaelith hasn't been seen in months. Is he dead? Planning something? The Isles are getting nervous. |\n| **Graza's Gambit** | The Queen wants to challenge The Storm—politically, not militarily. She needs allies. |\n| **Goblin-Hobgoblin Crisis** | A trade dispute threatens the Skarath-Ironhold partnership. If it breaks, the Isles lose both ships and weapons. |\n| **The Old Alliance** | Stormcrag's orc clans are fracturing. Old blood feuds resurface. Civil war could follow. |\n| **The Mistwood Secret** | Something stirs in the ancient ruins. Chief Varka needs outside help—but outsiders aren't welcome. |\n| **The Mainland Invasion** | The Empire or Kingdom finally decides to attack. Can the Isles unite in time? |\n\n---",
