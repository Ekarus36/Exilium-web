  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nPlain by elven standards—deliberately so. Brown hair kept simple, modest robes in grey and silver, no jewelry. Forgettable until she looks at you. Her eyes are unsettling: pale grey, unblinking, seemingly seeing through pretense to truth beneath. Speaks softly, moves quietly, appears without fanfare.\n\n### Personality (Public)\nPatient as stone. Never angry, never frustrated, never rushed. Asks questions others wouldn't think to ask. Waits through silences that make suspects confess just to fill the void. Shows no emotion during interrogations—witnesses describe it as \"being examined by a statue.\"\n\n### Role & Methods\n- **Investigations**: Major crimes, noble scandals, threats to the Empire\n- **Interrogations**: Legendary skill at extracting truth without torture\n- **Prosecutions**: Presents cases in the Hall of Echoes\n- **The 100-Year Review**: Conducts achievement investigations for justice\n\n### Famous Cases\n- The Merchant Conspiracy (100 years ago) - Exposed 12 nobles in trade fraud\n- The Forger of Lineages (80 years ago) - Caught an elf falsifying bloodlines\n- The Veiled Murders (50 years ago) - Solved seven \"accidental\" deaths\n- The Traitor's Evidence (80 years ago) - Built the case against Thaelen Ruincalen\n\n### Her Technique\nShe doesn't threaten. She doesn't deceive. She asks questions—simple, quiet, patient questions. Then she waits. And asks another. And waits. After hours of her soft grey eyes and softer voice, people tell her everything. Not from fear. From the unbearable weight of her attention.\n\n### Reputation\n- Criminals fear her (she always finds the truth)\n- Nobles resent her (their status doesn't protect them)\n- Commoners respect her (she's fair, if terrifying)\n- Other Truthseekers study her methods (none can replicate them)\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nNalindra Quietvoice is exactly what she appears to be: a seeker of truth. But 380 years of seeking truth has taught her something terrible—truth doesn't equal justice. The system she serves punishes the powerless and protects the powerful. The 100-Year Review favors the old over the young. The drow policy punishes children for ancestors' sins.\n\nShe knows all this. She serves anyway. Because if she doesn't seek truth, who will? And because she hopes—still, after everything—that truth matters. That eventually, enough truth might change things.\n\n### The Thaelen Case\nShe built the case that declared Thaelen Ruincalen a traitor. The evidence was clear: he abandoned his mission, defected to a human, took the last dragon. Open and shut.\n\n**But she interviewed witnesses. She read reports. And she wondered:**\n- Why did Caerwyn send their best warrior to kill one human?\n- What was Vera Wyrdweaver's actual crime?\n- Was Thaelen a traitor, or did he simply see something the Empire refused to see?\n\nShe presented the facts. Thaelorin ruled. Thaelen was condemned. She's spent 80 years wondering if she prosecuted an innocent elf.\n\n### Her Private Doubts\nShe keeps a journal (hidden, encoded) of cases where truth and justice diverged:\n- Young elves punished harshly under the 100-Year Review (no time to achieve)\n- Non-elves executed for crimes that would earn elves fines\n- Nobles whose \"investigations\" were quietly dropped\n- The drow she's prosecuted whose only crime was existing\n\nThe journal is 200 years old. It's nearly full.\n\n### What She Knows About the System\n- Which noble houses buy favorable rulings\n- Which judges can be influenced\n- How the achievement system protects the privileged\n- That Thaelorin knows the system is flawed—and maintains it anyway\n\n### The Question That Haunts Her\nIf she revealed everything—the corruption, the inequality, the moral bankruptcy—would it fix the system? Or just destroy what order exists? She's never found an answer she can live with.\n\n### What She Wants\n- Truth to matter (not just be recorded)\n- Justice to be just (not just consistent)\n- To understand why she still serves\n- Perhaps: someone to tell her what to do with her journal\n\n### What She Fears\n- Becoming what she investigates (corrupt, compromised)\n- Her doubts being discovered (she'd be ruined)\n- Dying without ever seeing real justice\n- The truth being that nothing can change\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Investigation** | She's investigating something connected to PCs. Her questions are uncomfortable. |\n| **The Journal** | She approaches PCs about her evidence of corruption. Does she want them to act? |\n| **The Thaelen Question** | She wants to interview someone who knows Thaelen. She has doubts she can't voice. |\n| **The Noble Crime** | A Great House commits clear crimes. She needs help gathering evidence they can't suppress. |\n| **The Review** | A PC or ally faces the 100-Year Review. She's the prosecutor—but is she fair? |\n| **The Confession** | She's ready to reveal everything. She needs protection. Or she needs to be stopped. |\n\n---",
