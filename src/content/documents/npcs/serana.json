Most dismiss it as paranoid fantasy. Those who've encountered Serana's work directly... don't talk about it. Some because they've been bought.

  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\n\n**Variable.** Serana has no fixed appearance—she appears differently depending on context:\n- At court: Plain lady-in-waiting, easily overlooked\n- In the field: Whatever the situation requires\n- To subordinates: Forgettable middle-aged woman in servant's clothes\n\n**Consistent features** (if you know to look):\n- Unremarkable brown eyes that notice everything\n- Moves quietly, almost unconsciously\n- Voice that blends into background noise\n- Never draws attention, never stands out\n\n### What She Runs\n\nThe Queen's intelligence network:\n- Agents in every Lord's household (servants, guards, ladies-in-waiting)\n- Informants in every major city and trade hub\n- Specialized operatives for sensitive work\n- \"Direct methods\" capability (assassination, blackmail, sabotage)\n\n**Network size:** Unknown, even to Margarethe. Estimated 50-100 active agents plus hundreds of informants.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### Her Origins\n\nEven Serana's real name is unknown. What is known:\n- Recruited from somewhere by Margarethe's mother (the previous queen)\n- Has served the crown for at least 30 years\n- No family, no attachments, no weaknesses discovered\n- May have been a criminal, an exile, or something stranger\n\n**Margarethe inherited her** when she became Queen. The arrangement was simple: absolute loyalty in exchange for absolute protection. Serana has never wavered.\n\n### Her Methods\n\n**Information Gathering:**\n- Servants who report conversations\n- Ladies-in-waiting who share court gossip\n- Merchants who note unusual purchases\n- Guards who notice comings and goings\n- Lovers who hear pillow talk\n\n**Direct Action:**\n- Poison (her specialty—untraceable blends)\n- \"Accidents\" (falls, fires, hunting mishaps)\n- Disappearances (rare, risky, effective)\n- Blackmail (preferred—assets remain useful)\n\n**What she won't do:**\n- Harm children (absolute line)\n- Act against the crown's interests\n- Leave evidence that traces to Margarethe\n\n### Her Current Operations\n\n**Watching:**\n- Lord Blackthorne (highest priority—evidence of murders exists somewhere)\n- Marcus Ravenscar (being recruited by Blackthorne)\n- The Graustein succession crisis (all three sons)\n- Prince Roderick's concerning friendships\n\n**Active:**\n- Agent in Blackthorne Tower (Seraphina doesn't know)\n- Monitoring Lord Ashfeld's Veraheim obsession\n- Tracking pirate connections of certain lords\n- Vetting potential matches for the princesses\n\n### Her Relationship with Margarethe\n\n**The dynamic:**\n- Margarethe gives direction; Serana executes\n- The Queen doesn't need to know every detail\n- Regular reports in private, often at night\n- Complete trust—perhaps the only relationship of Margarethe's built on truth\n\n**What Serana thinks of Margarethe:**\n- Respects her ruthlessness\n- Worries about the Roderick blind spot\n- Would die for her—and has killed for her\n- Considers her the only person who matters\n\n### Her Network's Limits\n\n**What Serana can't penetrate:**\n- Veraheim (Vera's wards detect foreign agents)\n- The Thelassian (different races too obvious)\n- Broken Isles (Vaelith's counter-intelligence superior)\n- Lord Thornwood's household (he's too careful)\n\n**What she doesn't know:**\n- The full extent of Blackthorne's crimes\n- Where the evidence of his murders is hidden\n- What the drow underground network moves through the Kingdom\n- That one of her agents is actually Blackthorne's double\n\n### The Blackthorne Problem\n\nSerana knows Edmund murdered his family. She knows Seraphina has evidence. The challenge:\n- Extracting Seraphina risks the agent in place\n- The evidence location is unknown\n- Moving too early warns Edmund\n- Moving too late lets him become untouchable\n\n**Her recommendation to Margarethe:** Wait. Build the case. Strike only when certain.\n\n**Margarethe's response:** Her standing order remains—if Aldric dies, Blackthorne dies within the hour regardless of evidence.\n\n### Plot Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Queen's Hand** | PCs encounter Serana's work. She offers a job—or a warning. |\n| **The Double Agent** | One of Serana's people is feeding information to Blackthorne. Find them. |\n| **The Extraction** | Serana needs someone to get Seraphina out. Her agents can't—they'd be traced. Outsiders could. |\n| **The Files** | Serana's documentation on the Lords. If stolen, kingdoms fall. If recovered, rewards. |\n| **The Successor** | Serana isn't immortal. She's quietly looking for someone to train. Could be a PC. |\n| **The Counter-Move** | Someone's hunting Serana. Blackthorne? The Empire? Someone new? |\n\n### If Serana Falls\n\nThe network doesn't collapse—it fragments:\n- Regional handlers would continue independently\n- Some agents would sell themselves to Lords\n- Others would disappear\n- Margarethe loses her greatest asset\n\n**Who would replace her?** No one could, fully. The Queen would become partially blind—and much more dangerous in her uncertainty.\n\n---",
