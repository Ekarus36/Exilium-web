  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nSoft body, clearly lives well. Silver hair, perfectly styled. Warm brown eyes that calculate while smiling. Impeccably dressed, always the finest fabrics. Manicured hands that have never held a sword. Pleasant expression that never quite reaches his eyes.\n\n### Personality\nCharming, cultured, sophisticated. Every word is chosen, every gesture planned. Genuinely loves art, wine, and music. Views politics as the highest art form. Patient—plays the long game. Never forgets a debt or an insult. Appears harmless, which is exactly what he wants.\n\n### Family\n- **Wife:** Lady Vivienne (née Graustein, 52) - Lord Graustein's niece. Unhappy marriage, she focuses on children and gardens.\n- **Heir:** Philippe (29) - Drunk, gambler, womanizer. Entirely unfit. Father's despair.\n- **Second Son:** Lucien (26) - Intelligent, patient, dangerous. Should inherit but won't.\n- **Daughter:** Marian (21) - Betrothed to Edmund Ravenscar. Will dominate that marriage.\n- **Youngest:** Antoine (18) - Artist, no political interest, the only happy Belmont.\n\n### Domain & Wealth\nRules ~22,000 people in the fertile heartland. Produces famous wines, luxury goods, and most importantly—runs the Kingdom's banking. The Belmont Bank holds debts from multiple Lords. This is his true power.\n\n### Known Debtors\nEveryone knows Belmont holds major debts:\n- Lord Graustein: significant (declining house)\n- Lord Blackthorne: substantial (military expansion)\n- Lord Ashfeld: moderate (Veraheim dreams)\n- Even the Crown borrows occasionally (always repaid)\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nCharles is exactly the manipulator he appears to be—but he's not evil in a dramatic sense. He's a businessman who treats nobility like commerce. He doesn't want power for its own sake; he wants security, influence, and legacy. He'd deal with anyone, support any cause, if the price was right.\n\n### The Debt Numbers\nActual amounts owed to Belmont Bank:\n- **Graustein:** 20,000 gold (crushing, could call anytime)\n- **Blackthorne:** 15,000 gold (dangerous debtor)\n- **Ashfeld:** 8,000 gold (manageable leverage)\n- **Crown:** 5,000 gold (short-term, always repaid)\n- Various minor nobles: 10,000+ gold total\n\nCharles rarely calls debts. The threat is more valuable than the gold.\n\n### The Secret Ledger\nCharles keeps a hidden ledger recording:\n- Every favor owed\n- Every debt unpaid\n- Every secret discovered\n- Every leverage point identified\n\nThis ledger is hidden somewhere in Château Belmont. It would be worth killing for.\n\n### The Succession Crisis\nCharles faces a terrible choice:\n- **Philippe** will inherit and destroy everything\n- **Lucien** should inherit but is second-born\n- Disinheriting Philippe would cause scandal\n- But Philippe inheriting would be catastrophe\n\nCharles is quietly considering \"options.\" Nothing decided yet. Lucien is almost certainly considering the same.\n\n### Vivienne's Betrayal\nHis wife corresponds with her Graustein relatives:\n- Provides intelligence about Belmont activities\n- Charles doesn't know (or pretends not to)\n- Not malicious—just maintaining family ties\n- Could be exploited by enemies\n\n### What He Wants\n- Influence without responsibility\n- His family permanently powerful\n- The finest things in life\n- To be remembered as a great man\n\n### What He Fears\n- Losing his wealth\n- Being outmaneuvered at his own game\n- Philippe inheriting\n- Open warfare (gold means less when swords are drawn)\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Ledger** | Someone wants the secret ledger. Protecting or stealing it is a major quest. |\n| **Debt Collection** | Charles calls in a debt. The consequences ripple through the Kingdom. |\n| **Brother vs Brother** | Lucien makes his move against Philippe. Which side do the PCs take? |\n| **The Golden Cage** | Charles offers patronage. The pay is excellent. The strings are invisible—at first. |\n| **Antoine's Trouble** | The innocent youngest son witnesses something he shouldn't. Now he's in danger. |\n\n---",
