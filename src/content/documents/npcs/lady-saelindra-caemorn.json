  "commonKnowledge": "### Appearance & Manner\nElegant without ostentation—her clothes are perfectly tailored but never flashy, her jewelry valuable but subtle. Silver hair arranged in elaborate traditional styles. Eyes the color of aged amber, always calculating. Moves with the confidence of someone who has never worried about money and never will. Her smile is warm; her accountants are not.\n\n### Personality (Public)\nGracious, cultured, charming. Hosts the most sought-after salons in the Inner City. Speaks multiple languages, knows everyone's business, remembers everyone's names. Appears friendly but every interaction is assessed for value. She's not cruel—she's efficient. Friendship and profit aren't mutually exclusive.\n\n### House Caemorn's Wealth\nThe family fortune comes from:\n- **Trade networks**: Routes connecting all ten enclaves\n- **Banking**: Loans to lesser houses, guilds, even the Imperial treasury\n- **Property**: Holdings in every enclave, managed forests, mines\n- **Information**: Knowing what's worth buying before others do\n\nHouse Caemorn doesn't produce goods—they move them, finance them, and take a percentage of everything.\n\n### Political Influence\n- **Granite Tower**: Faendril consults her on major economic decisions\n- **Other Houses**: Most owe Caemorn money or favors\n- **Guilds**: Many are partially financed by Caemorn investments\n- **The Emperor**: She's been summoned to advise on economic matters\n\n### Her Methods\nShe doesn't threaten or coerce. She simply makes cooperation more profitable than resistance. Enemy one decade, ally the next—business is business. The only thing she won't forgive is bad investments.\n\n---",
  "secretKnowledge": "### True Nature\nSaelindra Caemorn is not greedy. Greed is for those who don't have enough. She has more gold than she could spend in ten elven lifetimes. What she wants is influence—the ability to shape the Empire's future through economic power rather than military force or political office.\n\nShe believes the Pillars are obsolete. Military strength means nothing when you can bankrupt armies. Law means nothing when you can buy judges. Magic and diplomacy mean nothing when you control the resources everyone needs. The real power has always been economic. She simply makes it obvious.\n\n### The Veraheim Investment\nShe has secretly invested in Veraheim.\n\nNot directly—that would be treason. But through intermediaries, shell companies, and deniable assets, House Caemorn profits from tunnel tolls, Veraheim trade, and the sanctuary's success. She doesn't care about politics. She cares about returns.\n\nIf this became public, House Caemorn would fall. But Saelindra didn't become the wealthiest elf alive by taking stupid risks. The trail is buried under 80 years of careful accounting.\n\n### What She Knows About the Empire\n- The drow policy costs the Empire millions in potential trade annually\n- The Aloria's debt crisis makes them vulnerable to economic warfare\n- Faendril agrees with her reforms but lacks the courage to implement them\n- At least three Great Houses would collapse without Caemorn loans\n\n### Her Real Opinion on Elven Supremacy\nShe finds it economically inconvenient. Racism limits trading partners, wastes non-elven talent, and creates unnecessary enemies. She doesn't care about moral arguments—equality would simply be more profitable.\n\nShe'll never say this publicly. But she invests accordingly.\n\n### The Succession Problem\nShe has three children:\n- **Vaelindis Caemorn** (son, 350): Competent but cautious, would maintain wealth\n- **Aelindra Caemorn** (daughter, 280): Brilliant but reckless, would gamble everything on expansion\n- **Thelindor Caemorn** (son, 200): No interest in business, wants to be an artist\n\nNone of them are her. She has 200+ years left to live, but she worries about what happens after.\n\n### What She Wants\n- House Caemorn to remain dominant (legacy)\n- Economic reform in the Empire (it would make everyone richer, including her)\n- A worthy successor (none of her children qualify yet)\n- Perhaps: to see the Empire become what it could be, not what tradition demands\n\n### What She Fears\n- Economic collapse (destroys her work, not her personally)\n- Her Veraheim investments exposed (ruin)\n- A successor who squanders the fortune (legacy destroyed)\n- Dying before the Empire modernizes (unfinished work)\n\n### Story Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The Investment** | She hires PCs for a sensitive task related to Veraheim. Discretion is essential. |\n| **The Loan** | PCs need resources. She offers—but what does she want in return? |\n| **The Exposure** | Someone discovers her Veraheim connections. She needs the evidence destroyed. |\n| **The Heir** | She tests PCs as potential advisors for her succession planning. |\n| **The Reform** | She's ready to push for economic change. She needs allies outside traditional power structures. |\n| **The Crisis** | Economic disaster threatens the Empire. She's the only one who can fix it—at a price. |\n\n---",
